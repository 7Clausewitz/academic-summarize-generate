<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>ZIF-8 nanoparticles were constructed to package thrombin and TPZ by a simple but effective encapsulation approach. <ref>Zhang, L and Wan, S and Li, C and Xu, L and Cheng, H and Zhang, X. Nano Lett. 2018;18:7609.</ref>o fabricate the cancer-targeting nanosystem (Th-TPZ@MOF-FA), mPEG 2k -FA (FA-PEG) as the targeting ligand was bound to the surface of ZIF-8 nanoparticles.The schematic synthesis of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was shown in Figure 2A.Non targeted nanoparticles (Th-TPZ@MOF-PEG) were also synthesized in the same way by adding mPEG 2k -COOH for comparison.The maximum encapsulation efficiency of thrombin calculated by thrombin activity fluorometric kit is 92.92% (Table S1, Supporting Information).The maximum encapsulated amount of TPZ is 13.82% as determined by UV-vis analysis (Table S2  Preparation, characterization, and thrombin activity of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA.A) Schematic synthesis of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA and the pH-induced degradation of the MOF carrier for the release of TPZ and thrombin.B,C) Representative TEM images of Th-TPZ@MOF (B) and Th-TPZ@MOF-FA (C).D) Dynamic light scattering data of Th-TPZ@MOF and Th-TPZ@MOF-FA.E) Zeta potential, F) FTIR spectra, G) PXRD patterns, H) UV-vis absorption spectra, and I) thrombin activity of various samples indicated.J,K) In vitro release of TPZ (J) and thrombin (K) from Th-TPZ@MOF-FA in the buffer solutions of pH 7.4 and 6.5.</p>
<p>Supporting Information).The relatively low encapsulation efficiency of TPZ in aqueous solution may be due to its hydrophobic property.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Th-TPZ@MOF (the nanosystem without the FA-PEG addition) and Th-TPZ@MOF-FA both display spherical shape and uniform dispersion (Figure 2B,C).Corresponding enlarged TEM images and scanning images are shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information, showing that the size distribution is 90 nm.To further study the encapsulation of thrombin and TPZ in the MOF, energy-dispersive X-ray mapping images of an individual Th-TPZ@MOF were determined (Figure S2, Supporting Information).The sulfur element in the inner portion of the MOF indicates that thrombin is encapsulated inside the MOF.Furthermore, the confocal microscopy images (Figure S3, Supporting Information) of the MOF loaded with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-modified thrombin (green) and rhodamine B (RhB, red, as the TPZ substitute) display both colors in the inner part of the MOF, further proving that thrombin and TPZ are encapsulated inside the MOF.After the surface modification of FA-PEG from Th-TPZ@MOF to Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, the -potential changes from +18.3 to -1.09 mV (Figure 2D).The change is resulted from the carboxylic ions of FA-PEG, confirming the successful functionalization.Meanwhile, the hydrodynamic particle sizes of Th-TPZ@MOF and Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA present narrow peaks with average values of 155.4 and 179.2 nm, respectively (Figure 2E).More importantly, Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA exhibited high stability in various physiological environments and could maintain for a long time (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which could be attributed to the stabilization of the introduced FA-PEG.</p>
<p>To ensure the effective preparation, Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was also examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).The characteristic absorption bands at 1023 nm (O=C-RR', thrombin), 1060-1275 nm (C-O-C, FA-PEG), 1500-1690 nm (N=O, TPZ), and 2850-2930 nm (-CH 2 , FA-PEG) were observed in the FTIR spectrum (Figure 2F) of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA.As investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) in Figure 2G, the crystalline structure of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was not obviously changed as compared with that of the pure MOF, indicating that the package of thrombin and TPZ and the surface modification had a negligible effect on the crystalline feature of the MOF host.The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of Th-TPZ@MOF (480.5 m 2 g -1 ) is smaller than that of pure MOF (1096.5 m 2 g -1 ), which proves the presence of loaded thrombin and TPZ (Figure S5, Supporting Information).In addition, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA shows an obvious TPZ characteristic absorption peak at 470 nm (Figure 2H), further indicating the successful loading of TPZ.Moreover, biological activity assays demonstrate that thrombin-loaded Th-TPZ@MOF-FA retains the catalytic activity as free thrombin (Figure 2I).</p>
<p>In order to study the pH-responsive behavior of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA, pH 7.4 and 6.5 phosphate buffers were used to simulate normal physiological and tumor microenvironment conditions, respectively.As observed from the TEM images (Figure S6A, Supporting Information), after 4 h, Th-TPZ@MOF-FA could still maintain a good integrity at pH 7.4, but obvious dissociation was found at pH 6.5.In addition, the TEM images obtained from different times at pH 6.5 (Figure S6B, Sup-porting Information) indicated that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was gradually degraded, facilitating the subsequent unloading of the payload.As shown in Figure S7, Supporting Information, after the acid treatment, the supernatant showed obvious TPZ absorption peak, revealing the burst release of the prodrug.According to the standard absorbance curve of TPZ (Figure S8, Supporting Information), the prodrug release rate of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA over time at different pH was measured (Figure 2J).It was found that the maximum release rate of TPZ reached 73.2% in a few hours.Similarly, the release of thrombin from Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was faster at pH 6.5 than that occurred at pH 7.4, and its activity was not affected by mild acidity (Figure 2K).The difference of maximum release rate of thrombin was as high as 40.5% (Figure S9, Supporting Information).These results clearly indicate that the nanocarrier has pH-responsive release behavior, and can selectively release the payload to acidic tumor microenvironment over neutral physiological microenvironment.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the efficient hepatoma cell-targeting property of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, we prepared a system (Th-TPZ@ MOF-PEG) without the FA targeting ligand for comparison.These systems labeled with green fluorescent 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) dye were co-incubated with hepatoma cells (HepG2 cells) and normal cells (COS7 cells), and observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).As shown in Figure 3A and Figure S10A, Supporting Information, by comparing with the blank group, dim green fluorescence was found in HepG2 cells for the Th-TPZ@MOF-PEG group.Encouragingly, the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group exhibited significantly green fluorescence in HepG2 cells.As indicated by 3D confocal imaging, the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group had higher fluorescence than the Th-TPZ@MOF-PEG group.In addition, flow cytometric analysis (Figure 3B and Figure S10B, Supporting Information) also reveals the consistent results with CLSM imaging that the suspended HepG2 cells after co-incubated with Th-TPZ@MOF-FA showed significantly stronger fluorescence signal (91.79%) than that of non-targeting one (57.51%),indicating that FA could promote selective cellular uptake into hepatoma cells.In contrast, no visible green fluorescence signal was observed in COS7 cells by CLSM and flow cytometry analysis under the same conditions (Figures S11 andS12, Supporting Information).Then, organelle-specific fluorescent probes (i.e., LysoTracker Green and Hoechst 33342) were used to stain the lysosomes and nucleus.As shown in Figure S13, Supporting Information, the overlapping of green fluorescence (lysosome) and red fluorescence (Th-TPZ@MOF-FA (RhB)) was observed, indicating that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was endocytosed through the lysosome pathway beneficial to the pH-responsive release behavior.</p>
<p>For exploring the in vitro antitumor effect of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, the selective toxicity of free TPZ on HepG2 cells was first evaluated in normoxic (21% O 2 ) and hypoxic (2% O 2 ) environments.As expected, TPZ exhibited higher toxicity in hypoxia than that in normoxia (Figure S14A, Supporting Information).The living and dead cell staining via Calcein-AM/PI kit further confirmed that TPZ required low oxygen to activate chemotherapeutic toxicity (Figure S14B, Supporting Information).The acidic and hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumor is conducive to the release and activation of TPZ.As shown in Figure 3C, when HepG2 cells were treated with Th-TPZ@MOF-FA at pH 7.4 under normoxic condition, all cells exhibited green fluorescence, implying the well biocompatibility of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA under normal physiological environment.When cells were executed at pH 6.5 under hypoxic condition, obvious red fluorescence was observed, suggesting the responsive activation capability of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA in leading efficient chemotherapy.Once acidic or hypoxic condition is absent, the cytotoxicity of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA would drop sharply, demonstrating that the damage of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA to cells is closely dependent on the simultaneous stimulation of the microenvironment (acidity and hypoxia).Single stimulus could not effectively trigger the toxicity of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, ensuring its high precision therapy to tumor cells.</p>
<p>Next, the cell viability was evaluated via methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay in Figure 3D.Under normoxic environment, Th-TPZ@MOF-FA showed very low toxicity.Even at very high concentrations, the cell viability was still above 50% at pH 6.5 or 7.4.This is due to the fact that TPZ is a hypoxia-activated prodrug and has low toxicity under normoxic condition.By sharp contrast, for Th-TPZ@MOF-FA in HepG2 cells under hypoxic condition, the difference of cell viability under different pH reached 41.5%, and the survival rate at 6.5 pH was only 18.9%.No cytotoxic effect of the pure MOFs on the HepG2 cells could be detected under hypoxic condition (Figure S15A, Supporting Information).The toxicity of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA to normal cells (COS7 cells) was low, and the survival rate of COS7 cells was still higher than 50% even at high concentration of 60 mg L -1 (Figure S15B, Supporting Information).Importantly, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of free MOF is 88.9 (pH 7.4) and 84.7 (pH 6.5) mg L -1 respectively (Figure S16, Supporting Information), which is higher than the dose concentration of the therapeutic nanosystem used in this work and 30 mg L -1 of pure ZIF-8 previously reported, <ref>Hoop, M and Walde, C and Ricc, R and Mushtaq, F and Terzopoulou, A and Chen, X and Demello, A and Doonan, C and Falcaro, P and Nelson, B and Puigmart-Luis, J and Pan, S. Appl. Mater. Today. 2018;11:13.</ref> revealing the material design novelty as compared with the prior art.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the apoptotic pathways of targeted and nontargeted nanocarriers were evaluated through Annexin V-FITC/ PI kit by flow cytometer.When cells underwent early apoptosis, phosphatidylserine was exposed from inside to outside of the cell membrane.Annexin V-FITC can specifically bind the extracellular exposed phosphatidyl serine and label it with green fluorescence.As shown in Figure 3E, for Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA only in the presence of both pH 6.5 and hypoxia, it showed a high apoptosis rate of 76.5% against HepG2 cells, suggesting that the "logic gate" based Th-TPZ@MOF-FA can realize high specificity in the tumor therapy.As for the nontargeted Th-TPZ@MOF-PEG, the apoptosis rate was much lower in the same conditions.Similarly, very little apoptosis of normal cells (COS7 cells) by Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was observed (Figure S17, Supporting Information).All these results again indicate that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA has highly selective cytotoxicity to hepatoma cells in tumor microenvironment and negligible toxicity to normal cells.</p>
<p>To study tumor-targeted accumulation of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, we intravenously injected Cy7 labeled Th-TPZ@MOF-FA into HepG2-tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice (tumor size of 100 mm 3 ).The in vivo fluorescence images (Figure 4A) indicate the progressive fluorescence enhancement at the tumor site within 6 h after the administration of 100 L Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA, which is mainly due to the EPR effect and the tar-geting ability of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA.Even at 24 h after the injection, the tumor still showed strong fluorescence, indicating that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA could maintain in the tumor site for a relatively long time.In contrast, Th-TPZ@MOF-PEG exhibited very weak fluorescence at the tumor site within 24 h.To more accurately assess the accumulation of the nanocarriers in tumors and other organs, the tissues were stripped from sacrificed mice and imaged, and quantitative fluorescence intensity was collected (Figure S18, Supporting Information).The results demonstrate that the fluorescence of the targeted Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA from the tumor tissues is significantly higher than that of non-targeted one, indicating selective accumulation of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA into tumor in vivo.Obvious fluorescence signals in the lung and weak signals in the kidney and liver were also noticed for the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group.While for the non-targeted group, the fluorescence signals were mainly found in the lung, kidney, and liver.Because lung, kidney, and liver are the main metabolic organs, nonspecific uptake of the nanocarriers is inevitable.</p>
<p>To determine whether the release of thrombin can induce the thrombus formation in vitro, the thrombus induction diagram was simulated by ex vivo blood clot as shown in Figure 4B, where fresh blood was incubated with various samples.As expected, there was no obvious blood clot formation after 6 h of saline treatment, which implied that a small amount of anticoagulant could avoid the interference of natural coagulation.Similarly, no blood clot was found in TPZ@ MOF-FA treated blood.However, when fresh blood was mixed with acid-activated Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, obvious blood clots formed at the bottom (Figure 4C).After 6 h, the formed clots were almost the same size as those treated with positive group of thrombin, confirming that acid-activated Th-TPZ@MOF-FA had an excellent coagulation effect.Subsequently, the selective thrombus formation in vivo was studied.6 h after the tail vein injection of Th-TPZ@MPF-FA, the tumor was more visibly bruised and blackened in comparison to the tumor treated with saline (Figure 4D), indicating the blood pooling from vascular disruption.After the tumor was peeled, the haemorrhagic areas were found in Th-TPZ@MOF-FA-treated tumor, but not in the saline group (Figure 4E).</p>
<p>To gain an insight into the structure of thrombus at the tumor site, tumor paraffin sections were examined.The thrombosis was found in Th-TPZ@MOF-FA-treated tumor by the hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 4F), on account of the observation of fibrin-containing clots.No visible thrombus was detected in the section of saline-treated tumor.To further investigate the in vivo anti-vasculature mechanism of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, tumor tissue sections were performed with the immunofluorescence staining.The blood flow was labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD31, and CLSM was used to observe the tumor vasculature imaging.As shown in Figure 4G, the blood vessels near the thrombus for the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group were sparse and very thin.In contrast, tumors in the PBS group were highly vascularized with relatively large vessels.This comparison indicates that that the nanoplatform had a potent antiangiogenesis activity, which would further improve the likelihood of the vessel obstruction.Meanwhile, all these tests were also performed using TPZ@MOF-FA as the control group, showing similar results to those in the saline group (no thrombus or antiangiogenesis was found, Figure S19, Supporting Information).These results collectively demonstrate that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA could successfully deliver the active thrombin to the tumor site, inducing the thrombosis and antiangiogenesis to strengthen vascular occlusion for improving the antitumor efficacy.</p>
<p>The occlusion of tumor vessels cuts off the blood supply of oxygen, which would lead to the aggravation of hypoxia in tumor site for a prolonged time.In order to directly verify this assumption, photoacoustic imaging was executed to monitor in real-time the oxygen content in tumor tissues of HCT116tumor-bearing mice by measuring tumor vascular saturated O 2 (sO 2 ) at two excitation wavelengths (750 and 850 nm).Vascular oxygen saturation was assessed by observing the signal intensity of hemoglobin (Hb) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2 ) in tumor blood, labeled blue and red respectively.When the  ) via a single tail-vein injection.Images were acquired in real time up to 24 h post injection, and the fluorescence images of tumors and major organs were photographed after the animals were sacrificed and their organs were resected.B) Schematic illustration of the blood clot formation process.C) Representative images of the blood clot formation at 0.5, 1, 3, and 6 h after being treated by saline, TPZ@MOF-FA, Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, and thrombin, respectively.D) Representative HepG2tumor-bearing mice at 6 h after the injection with Th-TPZ@MOF-FA (10 mg kg -1 ) or saline.E) Corresponding exfoliated tumors photographed.oxygen content decreases, the content of HbO 2 decreases, and the red signal weakens. <ref>Zhang, H and Maslov, K and Stoica, G and Wang, L.

Biotechnol. 2006;24:848.</ref>As shown in Figure 5A, the photoacoustic signal remained almost unchanged during 24 h after the TPZ@MOF-FA injection.While for the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group, there was an obvious decrease in the red signal at 6 h post-injection (5 mg kg -1 ).At 24 h post-injection, the sO 2 value dropped significantly.Upon increasing the injection concentration, relative decrease intensity of the red signal was similar at the same time point, substantiating that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA could effectively induce hypoxia within tumor in time-and dose-dependent manners.To more intuitively reflect the level of hypoxia, sO 2 was calculated quantitively in Figure 5B.For two concentrations of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, the sO 2 values were only 40.6% and 25.9% after 24 h.There was a significant decrease in oxygen saturation as compared with that before the injection.In contrast, no significant sO 2 (55.3%) fluctuation was found at 24 h post-injection of TPZ@MOF-FA when compared to the value before the injection (58.3%).The average Hb levels in the test areas were similar, excluding the difference of oxygen saturation caused by the difference of Hb quantity (Figure 5C).</p>
<p>Furthermore, hypoxia probe immunofluorescence staining assay was performed to determine the degree of hypoxia inside the tumor (Figure 5D).Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1), a typical marker of hypoxia, shows upregulation under hypoxic condition.After treatment, the Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA group exhibited stronger green fluorescence, explaining higher expression of HIF-1 inside the tumor.This observation suggests that the treatment of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA did enhance the hypoxia in the tumor.Moreover, higher dose of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA showed stronger ability to increase the hypoxia by observing stronger green fluorescence.In addition, the HIF-1 expression level in tumors remarkably increased over time after the injection of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA.More importantly, the higher the injection concentration, the faster the induction of hypoxia is (Figure S20, Supporting Information).These results of the photoacoustic imaging and HIF-1 immunofluorescence assay are consistent, revealing that Th-TPZ@MOF-FA could deprive the tumor oxygen and increase the tumor hypoxia.The reason should be attributed to the thrombin delivery by Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, leading to the formation of tumor thrombus.</p>
<p>For the antitumor effect, the HepG2-tumor-bearing mice (tumor size of 70 mm 3 ) received five intravenous injection treatments of saline, Th@MOF-FA, TPZ@MOF-FA, and Th-TPZ@MOF-FA at 2-day intervals.The tumor volume of mice was measured daily by a caliper during the treatments (Figure 6A).Compared with the saline group, the tumor growth speed of the Th@MOF-FA group was slightly slower, which should be due to thrombin-induced vascular occlusion to deprive the nutrition and oxygen and hinder the tumor growth.Meanwhile, TPZ@MOF-FA showed only limited tumor inhibition effect, mainly because of the low hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, verifying that the hypoxia from solid tumors is insufficient to activate TPZ to achieve significant therapeutic effect.Notably, the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group exhibited remarkable tumor suppression.During the treatments, there was no obvious mouse weight change as compared with the initial weight (Figure S21, Supporting Information).After 10-day treatments, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were peeled and weighed (Figure 6B).The tumor weight trend among these groups was consistent with their final size trend shown in Figure 6A.A typical stripped tumor image of each group is presented in Figure 6C.In order to evaluate the antitumor efficacy, another longer-term tumor growth inhibition experiment was carried out (Figure S22A, Supporting Information).The Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group showed the highest antitumor efficacy during 22 days of the treatment.The superior therapeutic efficacy of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA was also supported by the survival rate analysis (Figure S22B, Supporting Information).Specifically, HepG2-tumor-bearing mice treated with Th-TPZ@MOF-FA had a median survival time of 60 days, which are much longer than the other groups.Clearly, Th-TPZ@MOF-FA performed the most powerful antitumor ability on account of the combination of vascular occlusion and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Then, we explored the stage formation of thrombus in the tumor site over 24 h after the administration of Th-TPZ@ MOF-FA (Figure 6D).Thrombus gradually appeared in the tumor site upon time, which can be confirmed by the detection of extensive platelet aggregation via specific CD41 antibody on the surface of activated platelets.After 6 h, advanced thrombosis was observed, and by 24 h, there were dense thrombi.After 10 days of treatments, the therapeutic effect of these groups (Figure 6E) was further evaluated by CD41 antibody detection, H&E staining, and terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL).Activated platelets could only be found in the thrombin-containing groups, further proving that the activity of loaded thrombin was not affected, and it can successfully induce the thrombus in tumors.For the H&E staining, only the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group exhibited obvious nuclear shrinkage and damage, whereas no obvious damage was observed in other groups.Regarding the TUNEL staining, a large number of apoptotic cells were stained with green fluorescence from the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA group.There was only a small amount of necrosis in the Th@MOF-FA and TPZ@MOF-FA groups as compared with the saline group.</p>
<p>To evaluate the potential toxicity of these samples in vivo, the physiological morphology of the main organs (i.e., heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) in each group after the treatments was assessed by H&E staining (Figure S23, Supporting Information).It should be noted that, although acute blood clotting occurred in lung at 24 h post injection, the H&E staining results showed that the nanosystem did not cause detectable damage to the major organs.There was no pathological lesion in all tissues, implying their negligible side effect.Complete blood chemistry tests were also performed (Figure S24, Supporting Information).The values of common parameters including white blood cell, red blood cell, lymph, glutamic pyruvate transaminase (ALT), mean corpuscular volume, platelet count (PLT), thrombocytocrit (PCT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), granulocyte, monocyte (Mon%), hemoglobin (HGB) and creatinine (CR) were all within the normal ranges, suggesting that the present therapeutic strategy could be tolerated by mice.All together, these data indicate good safety of combining vascular occlusion with hypoxic prodrug chemotherapy in vivo.</p>

<p>The induction of thrombosis in tumor vasculature represents an appealing strategy for combating cancer. <ref>Huang, X and Molema, G and King, S and Watkins, L and Edgington, T and Thorpe, P.

Mater. 2019;31:1805955.</ref>Notably, tumor vascular infarction is the only modality manifesting long-term curative potential in mice.The complete thrombosis and subsequent eradication of tumors usually require a high dose of coaguligands, which may result in high side effects due to the coaguligand leakage. <ref>Jahanban-Esfahlan, R and Seidi, K and Zarghami, N. Int. J. Hematol. 2017;105:244.</ref>Therefore, rationally combining thrombin with the therapeutic prodrug into a MOF system has been built for thrombus activated chemotherapy.To accomplish the goal of thrombus activated chemotherapy, thrombin and TPZ have been encapsulated into the MOF carrier along with the introduction of the tumortargeting ligand FA.Upon selective tumor delivery and accumulation of Th-TPZ@MOF-FA, the exposed thrombin could spontaneously induce the vascular infarction and increase the level of hypoxia, thus boosting HAP-based therapy.The detailed in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the Th-TPZ@MOF-FA nanosystem possesses significantly improved anticancer capacity over other control groups.This coagulation based therapeutic strategy opens a window for the application of vascular infarction combined with other conventional therapy methods.More importantly, the current strategy is clinically meaningful and practical considering that coagulation often occurs at the tumor site during surgery.</p>

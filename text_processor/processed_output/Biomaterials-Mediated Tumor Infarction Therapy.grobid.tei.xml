<abstract>Agents for tumor vascular infarction are recently developed therapeutic agents for the vascular destruction of tumors.They can suppress the progression of the tumor by preventing the flow of nutrition and oxygen to its tissues.Agents of tumor vascular infarction can be divided into three categories according to the differences in their pathways of action: those that use the thrombin-activating pathway, fibrin-activating pathway, and platelet-activating pathway.However, poor targeting ability, low permeation, and potential side-effects restrict the development of the corresponding drugs.Biomaterials can subtly avoid these drawbacks to suppress the tumor.In this article, the authors summarize currently used biomaterials for tumor infarction therapy with the goal of identifying its mechanism, and discuss outstanding deficiencies in methods of this kind.</abstract>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Tumor vascular infarction-based therapy was proposed by <ref>Huang et al.</ref> to treat vascular-rich tumors <ref>Huang, X and Molema, G and King, S and Watkins, L and Edgington, T and Thorpe, P. Tumor Infarction in Mice by Antibody-Directed Targeting of Tissue Factor to Tumor Vasculature. Science. 1997;275:547-550. doi:10.1126/science.275.5299.547</ref>.And vascular blockade therapy and anti-angiogenic therapy together form a new and popular direction of oncology treatment -tumour vascular blockade therapy.Note that both vascular infraction and anti-angiogenesis approaches cut down the nutrients and oxygen supply to the tumor, which ultimately starve the cancer cells.Anti-angiogenesis destruct the neovasculature formation <ref>Oba, M and Vachutinsky, Y and Miyata, K and Kano, M and Ikeda, S and Nishiyama, N. Antiangiogenic Gene Therapy of Solid Tumor by Systemic Injection of Polyplex Micelles Loading Plasmid DNA Encoding Soluble Flt-1. Mol. Pharm. 2010;7(2):501-509. doi:10.1021/mp9002317</ref><ref>Dirisala, A and Osada, K and Chen, Q and Tockary, T and Machitani, K and Osawa, S. Optimized Rod Length of Polyplex Micelles for Maximizing Transfection Efficiency and Their Performance in Systemic Gene Therapy against Stroma-Rich Pancreatic Tumors. Biomaterials. 2014;35(20):5359-5368. doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.03.037</ref>.In contrast, vascular infraction approaches rely on clot formation within the tumor blood vessels to occlude the blood vessels that feed the tumor, subsequently causing necrosis and apoptosis of neoplastic cells.The effect of infarction treatment is almost immediate, in contrast to chemotherapy <ref>Pizzamiglio, S and Ciniselli, C and Triulzi, T and Gargiuli, C and De Cecco, L and De Azambuja, E. Integrated Molecular and Immune Phenotype of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer and Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy: A NeoALTTO Exploratory Analysis. Clin. Cancer Res. 2021;27(23):6307-6313. doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1600</ref>.For example, breast cancer needs to be treated with trastuzumab for at least 9 weeks, whereas infarction treatment requires only about 1/10 of this time <ref>Baselga, J and Tripathy, D and Mendelsohn, J and Baughman, S and Benz, C and Dantis, L. Phase II Study of Weekly Intravenous Recombinant Humanized Anti-p185HER2 Monoclonal Antibody in Patients with HER2/neu-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer. Jco. 1996;14(3):737-744. doi:10.1200/JCO.1996.14.3.737</ref>.Moreover, infarction treatment does not involve directly attacking the tumor cells or influencing their pathways, and thus is unlikely to lead to the development of resistance during treatment.The distribution of disordered blood vessels and the hypoxic condition of the microenvironment of the tumor result in hypercoagulable blood, which provides favorable conditions for the formation of the thrombus <ref>Tilki, D and Kilic, N and Sevinc, S and Zywietz, F and Stief, C and Ergun, S. Zonespecific Remodeling of Tumor Blood Vessels Affects Tumor Growth. Cancer. 2007;110(10):2347-2362. doi:10.1002/cncr.23024</ref>.</p>
<p>However, few infarction drugs are currently used in clinical practice.Only a truncated form of the tissue factor (tTF) has been approved by the U.S. Food And Drug Administration (FDA) <ref>Huang, X and Molema, G and King, S and Watkins, L and Edgington, T and Thorpe, P. Tumor Infarction in Mice by Antibody-Directed Targeting of Tissue Factor to Tumor Vasculature. Science. 1997;275:547-550. doi:10.1126/science.275.5299.547</ref><ref>Zhu, P and Zhu, J.-J.

Oncol. 2017;6(4):41. doi:10.21037/cco.2017.06.29</ref>.A few shortages have contributed to this situation.First, once bloodclotting substances form a thrombus in the normal tissues and block normal blood vessels, this causes secondary injuries to patients.Tumor patients in general have a high platelet count and high blood viscosity, which facilitates the formation of the thrombus to hinder the use of the agent <ref>Hisada, Y and Mackman, N. Cancer-associated Pathways and Biomarkers of Venous Thrombosis.

Cancer Cell. 2018;33(6):965-983. doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2018.03.002</ref>.Second, currently available clotting agents cannot completely block the blood vessels of the tumor, and the tumor cells can obtain nutrients from the remaining blood vessels or the normal surrounding environment <ref>Berdel, A and Schwppe, C and Brand, C and Harrach, S and Brmmel, K and Hintelmann, H. Targeting Tissue Factor to Tumor Vasculature to Induce Tumor Infarction. Cancers. 2021;13(11):2841. doi:10.3390/cancers13112841</ref>.Third, compared with normal blood vessels that have a complete morphology and distinct layers, tumorous blood vessels are primitive, usually lack smooth muscle cells and pericytes, and mainly rely on endothelial cells to transport nutrients and oxygen.The distribution of blood vessels in the tumor is thus disordered and the blood pressure is higher than normal, where this is not conducive to drug permeation <ref>Flessner, M and Choi, J and Credit, K and Deverkadra, R and Henderson, K.

<p>The above shows that treating tumors by using clotting drugs alone is a path riddled with obstacles.In this circumstance, the idea of combined therapy based on biomaterials and infarction agents offers promise to inhibit tumor progression <ref>Zheng, P and Liu, Y and Chen, J and Xu, W and Li, G and Ding, J.

<p>Most clotting drugs cause vascular infarction through different clotting pathways: by activating the fibrin, platelets, and thrombin (Table 1).Coagulation involves the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin as well as platelet activation and aggregation to form a hemostatic thrombus <ref>Ruggeri, Z and Mendolicchio, G. Adhesion Mechanisms in Platelet Function.

<p>Here, we divided the article into three parts according to the main activation direction of the treatment plan, as shown in Scheme 1. First, we consider the activation of the thrombin pathway.The classic drug in this context is tTF that, as the initiator of a pathway for exogenous clotting in the human body, is modified at the tumor site to produce clotting through biomaterials <ref>Bieker, R and Kessler, T and Schwppe, C and Padr, T and Persigehl, T and Bremer, C.

<h1>BIOMATERIALS-MEDIATED THERAPY THROUGH ACTIVATION OF THROMBIN PATHWAY</h1>

<p>The tTF containing the extracellular domain of the tissue factor has been used to induce thrombosis in tumorous blood vessels.It can cascade to the signaling pathways downstream to activate thrombin through pathways of exogenous clotting.The tTF has the following benefits: 1) Immune resistance.tTF derived from the human body has no activating effect on the immune system <ref>Kessler, T and Baumeier, A and Brand, C and Grau, M and Angenendt, L and Harrach, S.

Cancers. 2020;12(6):1488. doi:10.3390/cancers12061488</ref>.The results again proved that tTF-NGR, as a drug for vascular therapy, can suppress the tumor and is safe.</p>
<p>However, the synthesis of the targeting peptide is complicated and costly, which hinders its large-scale application.Li et al. conjugated a DNA aptamer targeting nucleolin (a protein that is overexpressed in the liver tumors) to the tTF, through cyclohexane-1carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC).The tTF-AS1411 conjugate could not only accurately target and inhibit the tumor, but also did not affect the normal tissues (Figure 1A) <ref>(Li et al., 2021b)</ref>.The data showed that tTF-AS1411 could significantly inhibit the growth of liver tumors on metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (MHCC-97H) (Figure 1B,C).Moreover, its simple process of preparation and low price enable the wide use of the conjugate.Nevertheless, AS1411 mainly acts on tumor cells rich in nucleolar protein, such as those that cause breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia.The specificity of AS1411 decreases for tumor cells with low nucleolar protein expression.</p>
<p>Thus, a material that can target most tumors is needed.CREKA (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala), as a tumor-homing peptide identified by phage display technology, can solve the above problem.</p>
<p>It can recognize microthrombus-related fibrin-fibronectin complexes that are selectively overexpressed in the vascular endothelium and stroma of the tumor but not in normal tissues <ref>Ruoslahti, E and Bhatia, S and Sailor, M.

<p>Shi et al. established three types of tumor models-the 4T1 model, the MHCC97H liver tumor model, and the LS174T colon tumor model-and treated the tumors with tTF-CREKA.CREKA and tTF were optimized for the prokaryotic cells and purified with isopropyl--D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) for 4 hours to obtain tTF-CREKA <ref>Xiong, Q and Lee, G and Ding, J and Li, W and Shi, J.

Nano Res. 2018;11(10):5281-5309. doi:10.1007/s12274-018-2146-1</ref>.The authors found that tTF-CREKA had an inhibitory effect on the tumors in the three models, especially in the 4T1 model, because this model featured more blood vessels than the other two <ref>Pulaski, B and Ostrand-Rosenberg, S. Mouse 4T1 Breast Tumor Model. Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 1934;39(1):368X. doi:10.1002/0471142735.im2002s39</ref>.The authors also compared tTF-CREKA with a truncated tissue factor with pH (low) insertion peptides (tTF-pHLIP).Under the same treatment conditions, the therapeutic effect of tTF-CREKA was almost the same as that of tTF-pHLIP on LS174T tumors but was more active against the 4T1 and MHCC97H tumors.This was mainly owing to its different effective positions on the tumor cells.Because pH-responsive drugs are not favorable for patients with diseases such as ischemic myocarditis <ref>Estabragh, Z and Mamas, M.

<p>However, the specific site at which CREKA binds to tumor cells is relatively simple such that the tumor cells are prone to generate avoidance mechanisms to avoid binding to the polypeptides.Kessler et al. localized the anti-NRP-1-mAb to the surface of the vascular endothelial cells of the tumor to induce vascular infarction (16) <ref>Kessler, T and Baumeier, A and Brand, C and Grau, M and Angenendt, L and Harrach, S.

<h1>BIOMATERIALS-MEDIATED THERAPY THROUGH ACTIVATION OF FIBRIN PATHWAY</h1>

Blood. 2001;97(3):652-659. doi:10.1182/blood.v97.3.652</ref>.To verify the effect of tCoa-RGD in terms of tumor inhibition, the authors established a CT26 mouse colon model, a 4T1 mouse breast model, and an SKOV3 human ovarian tumor model, and found that the systemic injection of lower doses of tCoa-RGD significantly inhibited solid tumor growth due to CT26, 4T1, and SKOV3 in animals.Thrombosis and a large number of necrotized tumor cells were also observed in the tumor tissues.The research showed that the tCoa-RGD fusion protein can induce thrombosis while ensuring non-toxicity in normal tissues.</p>
<p>However, the RGD peptide recognizes only the v3 integrin <ref>Ghabraie, E and Kemker, I and Tonali, N and Ismail, M and Dodero, V and Sewald, N.

<p>In addition to using coagulase to activate fibrinogen to form a fibrin network, some researchers sent fibrin directly into tumorous blood vessels to mediate the vascular blockage of the tumor.This strategy was safer and more efficient than previous blocking methods.<ref>Zhang et al. designed</ref>   His6, and normal LMMP on tumor treatment, and found that they were equivalent with respect to a lack of a targeting function, a lack of pH responsiveness, and dually regulated drugs, respectively.The results showed that the dual regulation drugs groups had better targeting and tumor-suppressive effects than the others <ref>Zhang, K and Yang, P.-P and He, P.-P and Wen, S.-F and Zou, X.-R and Fan, Y.

<p>However, currently commonly used drugs, such as combretastatin A4 and apatinib, have poor water solubility and low accuracy of targeting the tumor.CA4, as a clinical drug that has been marketed, has been approved by the FDA <ref>Rastogi, S and Zhao, Z and Barrett, S and Shelton, S and Zafferani, M and Anderson, H.

Release. 2013;170(3):445-451. doi:10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.06.015</ref>.Nanoparticles coated with the platelet membranes bound to the endothelial cells of the tumor by targeting proteins of receptors on the surface of the membrane to destroy the blood vessels.The damaged blood vessels attracted new nanoparticles to gather, thus realizing the self-amplification and aggregation of nanoparticles at the tumor site (Figure 3A).Thus, active tumor targeting and intra-tumor vascular disruption can be rendered interdependent and mutually reinforcing to yield significant antitumor effects.In addition, the two antiangiogenic agents acted on the tumor vessels in different directions to enhance these effects.The results also proved that a combination of the two drugs is more effective than monotherapy.However, this strategy is simply an enhanced version of the starvation therapy, in which tumors were killed without nutrients and oxygen.And it could not prevent the remaining tumor cells from acquiring material from the surrounding normal tissue, allowing the tumor to be inadequately cleared.When combined with conventional therapies that mostly target peripheral tumor cells, the tumor can be better suppressed (Figure 1B,C).<ref>Drzyzga et al. combined DMXAA (5,</ref><ref>6</ref>-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid) with radiotherapy to suppress tumor cells and the effect of the treatment <ref>Drzyzga, A and Cicho, T and Czapla, J and Jarosz-Biej, M and Pilny, E and Matuszczak, S.

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Novel approaches to treating tumors are driving a growing number of researchers to attend to the treatment of tumor vascular infarction.This article summarized three methods of drug activation that inhibit the growth of the tumor by causing vascular infarction, blocking substances from entering the tumor, and causing its necrosis.However, border cells can absorb nutrients and oxygen from normal tissues, which leads to the recurrence and metastasis of the tumor.This has prompted researchers to use vascular infarction therapy in conjunction with other treatments.</p>
<p>Drzyzga et al. combined vascular infarction therapy and radiotherapy to explore the best delivery conditions to improve treatment <ref>Drzyzga, A and Cicho, T and Czapla, J and Jarosz-Biej, M and Pilny, E and Matuszczak, S. The Proper Administration Sequence of Radiotherapy and Antivascular Agent-DMXAA Is Essential to Inhibit the Growth of Melanoma Tumors. Cancers. 2021;13(16):3924. doi:10.3390/cancers13163924</ref>.Thrombin and chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (Dox) have also been integrated into a single nanocarrier to enable chemotherapy and blood coagulation to work together.This is a feasible and reasonable means of attacking the tumor from different directions, and the two treatments complement each other's advantages to minimize the number of residual tumor cells <ref>Li, S and Zhang, Y and Ho, S.-H and Li, B and Wang, M and Deng, X. Combination of Tumour-Infarction Therapy and Chemotherapy via the Co-delivery of Doxorubicin and Thrombin Encapsulated in Tumour-Targeted Nanoparticles. Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020;4(7):732-742. doi:10.1038/s41551-020-0573-2</ref>.</p>
<p>(1) High cost: Regardless of whether peptides or nanorobots are used, it is important to ensure that the cost of treatment is acceptably low.(2) Rapid metabolism of biomaterials: In addition to not producing immune resistance to the human body, biological materials can be degraded in the body without producing harmful substances.However, they are quickly metabolized.Extending their duration of circulation in the body by slowing down their metabolism requires more research.</p>
<p>(3) Inefficient drug delivery: Most current TIBs are based on the EPR effect for tumor targeting and accumulation, and disorder of the blood vessels in the tumor leads to high intravascular pressure such that many drugs cannot be delivered to the tumor.We thus need to develop intelligent biological materials that are responsive to the pH, have redox potential, and are sensitive to overexpressed enzymes in the TME to increase the likelihood of the drugs acting on the tumor.(4) Biological safety: The number of platelets in tumor patients is higher than in normal people.If the biological material cannot accurately release the blood coagulation drug, thrombus can occur in normal blood circulation and cause organ damage.Therefore, doctors often reduce the amount of medication for patients during treatment, but this limits the use of large doses of drugs and leads to incomplete tumor elimination.Residual tumor cells can then rely on the remaining blood vessels to grow and metastasize.</p>
<p>We have summarized recent progress in research on the vascular obstruction of the tumor from three perspectives: activating the thrombin pathway, activating fibrin, and activating platelets.We concluded that the problems of poor water solubility and non-specific targeting can be solved with the help of biological materials.Coagulation drugs with a short halflife in the body (such as thrombin, coagulase, tissue factor, and DMSSA) can reach the vascular site of the tumor, and can even use biological materials as carriers to combine coagulation therapy with other, complementary treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and neovascularization suppression therapy).This significantly improves the ability to kill tumors and lowers the tumor's resistance to drugs.Coagulation therapy does not affect cell survival by changing the intra-cellular mechanism, and starves the tumorous cells by blocking the blood vessels so that they cannot alter their mechanism to escape, as they do in response to chemotherapy.In particular, infarction drugs supported by biological materials, whether activated by the thrombin pathway, platelet pathway, or fibrin pathway, are safer for the patient and more accurate at targeting the tumor than single drugs.Tumor vascular infarction therapy thus offers a wide range of options for tumor treatment.The emergence of biological materials has accelerated the emergence of such treatments, although daunting challenges persist to their use in clinical applications.</p>

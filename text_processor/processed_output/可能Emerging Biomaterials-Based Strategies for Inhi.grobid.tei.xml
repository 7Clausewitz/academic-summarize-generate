<p>It is also worth mentioned that the clinical usage of these tumor vasculature targeting reagents has been limited, due to their undesired sub-targeting effects and high dosage. <ref>Li, Z and Di, C and Li, S and Yang, X and Nie, G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2019;52:2703.</ref>In this case, novel strategies for tumor vascular targeting are in urgent needs to enhance therapeutic efficiency within safety consideration.</p>
<p>Fortunately, adapted to rapid advances in biomaterials, smart therapeutic systems, with tumor ECs targeting ability and multifunctionality for combined therapy, exhibit unparalleled potentials.Based on the particular structure and function of the tumor vasculature system, a number of delivery systems have been proposed for cancer starvation therapy.As a typical example, Nie's group has summarized their efforts in tumor vasculature targeting therapy by two opposing therapeutic philosophies: 1) to obstruct the blood supply by surgical topical delivery of both hydrogels and nanotargeted coagulation-active peptides; and 2) to increase the vascular permeability of nano-delivery systems for normalizing the blood vessels or platelet reduction, indicating the importance of this therapeutic strategies focusing on vasculature function in cancer therapy. <ref>Li, Z and Di, C and Li, S and Yang, X and Nie, G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2019;52:2703.</ref>However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive summary of existing researches from the perspective of therapy for tumors in obstructing blood vessel is not available.</p>
<p>Hence, in this report, current strategies of tumor vascular functional inhibition will be summarized, as shown in Figure 1.In recent years, there have been numerous studies on hydrogels as drug carriers and stents, while the potential of hydrogel as a physical embolic agent for hepatocellular carcinoma will be explored here.More significantly, the cancer therapy concerning thrombogenic activators loaded nanomaterials resulting in vascular obstruction has emerged in these two years, which is a novel and unreviewed therapy.In this case, it is worth sharing with discussion of its future development in oncology treatment.Furthermore, as one of the therapies to block tumor vascular function, the delivery of anti-vascular drugs will also be described.Although Chen et al. also noted that anti-vascular drugs are expected to be a promising approach for cancer treatment, <ref>Chen, D and Qu, X and Shao, J and Wang, W and Dong, X. J. Mater. Chem. B. 2020;8</ref> it will be focus on some of the more interesting and innovative studies (i.e., gene delivery systems, VDA-induced amplification strategy of nanoparticles and VDA-guided prodrug strategy) in this paper.In short, current tumor vasculature inhibiting therapeutic strategies include the utilization of hydrogel or nanogel to realize local trans-arterial embolization, the design of thrombogenic activator loaded nanomaterials to mediate vascular obstruction, and the development of combination carriers to deliver both angiogenesis inhibiting agents</p>
<p>The constant feeding of oxygen and nutrients through the blood vasculature has a vital role in maintaining tumor growth.Interestingly, recent endeavors have shown that nanotherapeutics with the strategy to block tumor blood vessels feeding nutrients and oxygen for starvation therapy can be helpful in cancer treatment.However, this field has not been detailed.Hence, this review will present an exhaustive summary of the existing biomaterial based strategies to disrupt tumor vascular function for effective cancer treatment, including hydrogel or nanogel-mediated local arterial embolism, thrombosis activator loaded nano-material-mediated vascular occlusion and anti-vascular drugs that block tumor vascular function, which may be beneficial to the design of anti-cancer nanomedicine by targeting the tumor vascular system.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Although a large number of anti-tumor drugs have been marketed for cancer treatment, cancer is still one of the main causes leading to the highest mortality rate in the world due to its poor therapeutic effect and undesired side effects. <ref>Maeda, H and Khatami, M. Clin. Transl. Med. 2018;7:11.</ref>In comparison with traditional chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgical resection, recent vascular interruption based tumor therapy represents a mild, effective, and long-lasting treatment approach which might bring hope to patients with weak tolerance. <ref>Padma, V. Biomedicine. 2015;5:19.</ref>In details, the constant flow of oxygen and nutrients through the blood vessels supports a sustained tumor growth, while this starvation therapy by blocking nutrient supply could significantly cause tumor shrinkage. <ref>Ruoslahti, E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002;2:83.</ref><ref>Carmeliet, P and Jain, R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2011;10:417.</ref><ref>Jain, R. Science. 2005;307:58.</ref> For example, tumor vasculature targeting strategy has been reported to be effective for the clinical treatment of both hematologic and solid tumors, <ref>Shao, Y and Guo, L and Li, A and Zhang, K and Liu, W and Shi, J and Liu, J and Zhang, Z.

<h1>Hydrogel-Mediated Local Transarterial Embolization for Cancer Therapy</h1>
<p>As one of popular vasculature function inhibition strategy, trans-catheter arterial embolization (TAE) aims to release an embolic agent into a target artery for the vascular obstruction and tumor cell starvation, via a catheter under the guidance of medical imaging device. <ref>Mattiuzzi, C and Lippi, G. J. Epidemiol. Global Health. 2019;9:217.</ref>This strategy is important for liver tumor treatment, as hepatic artery mainly supplies hepatic cancer cells, while normal cells get their nutrients mainly from the hepatic vein. <ref>Li, Z and Di, C and Li, S and Yang, X and Nie, G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2019;52:2703.</ref>Furthermore, surgical resection has problems such as low resection rate and high recurrence rate.In this case, vascular interventional embolization of the hepatic artery or its branches has been proved to be very useful to starve or to cause the necrosis of the blood-supplied tumor (Figure 2A).More importantly, this clinical revolutionary approach, with low frequency of complications and good integration with other therapies, has become the most commonly employed treatment for unresectable liver cancer. <ref>Qian, K and Ma, Y and Wan, J and Geng, S and Li, H and Fu, Q and Peng, X and Kan, X and Zhou, G and Liu, W and Xiong, B and Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Yang, X and Xu, H. J. Controlled Release. 2015;212:41.</ref>It is worthy to mention that the successful application of this strategy is heavily relied on the rational design of embolization reagents.Currently, the commonly used materials for vascular embolization include coils, polyvinyl alcohol particles, gelatin foam, lipiodol, etc.However, these materials still have limitations.For example, coil embolization has disadvantages such as incomplete embolization and coil migration.Particle embolization might cause non-targeted blood vessel embolization in the body and blockage in the catheter, <ref>Poursaid, A and Jensen, M and Nourbakhsh, I and Weisenberger, M and Hellgeth, J and Sampath, S and Cappello, J and Ghandehari, H. Mol. Pharmaceutics. 2016;13:2736.</ref> and it might also induce the undesired embolism.On the other hand, gelation foam is good for embolization but not easy for injection.In comparison with the above particle based solution, lipiodol in liquid form has the advantage of easy injection and could even serve as contrast agent. <ref>Poursaid, A and Jensen, M and Nourbakhsh, I and Weisenberger, M and Hellgeth, J and Sampath, S and Cappello, J and Ghandehari, H. Mol. Pharmaceutics. 2016;13:2736.</ref><ref>Poupart, O and Schmocker, A and Conti, R and Moser, C and Nuss, K and Grtzmacher, H and Mosimann, P and Pioletti, D. Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2020;8:261.</ref>However, it still suffers from undesired stability issue, which required frequent dosing and caused uncomfortable patient compliance. <ref>Li, X and Liu, W and Ye, G and Zhang, B and Zhu, D and Yao, K and Liu, Z and Sheng, X. Biomaterials. 2005;26:7002.</ref>Alternatively, an ideal embolic agent should be a simple, homogeneous, aqueous solution that is transported in a flowable liquid state through the microcatheter, but it might fast form a solid state of aggregation once it reaches the targeting site.Fortunately, recent reports have showed that hydrogels with stimulus responsive or in situ formation ability could perfectly fit the above requirements and even bring other beneficial characteristics, including biodegradation, drug-loading capacity, and iohexol or other contrast agents trapping ability. <ref>Nguyen, Q and Lee, M and Lym, J and Kim, Y and Jae, H and Lee, D. J. Mater. Chem. B. 2016;4:6524.</ref>n details, hydrogels are usually made of nanoscale colloidal polymeric networks formed by physical or chemical crosslinking (Figure 2B), which could serve as popular delivery carriers of small molecular drugs, biologics, or imaging agents.Although this is a novel and interesting approach for TAE, the systematic summary of this field is still largely unexplored.A summary of promising hydrogel nanomaterials by either physical or chemical cross-linking under development is presented in Table 1.The hydrogel liquid realizes the solution-gel transition in response to different internal or external environmental factors, in terms of temperature, pH, ionic strength, etc., while intermolecular polymerization could complete coagulation transformation for gelatinization.In this section, currently reported potential hydrogels in the field of tumor vascular embolization therapy will be introduced, including gelation mechanism, embolization efficacy, and their unique design for TAE.Thermosensitive hydrogels with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) characteristics have been used as a novel generation of embolic materials.When the temperature rises above the LCST, the solution goes through a sol-gel transition, resulting in vascular occlusion. <ref>Ramos, J and Imaz, A and Forcada, J. Polym. Chem. 2012;3:852.</ref>The detail hydrogel formation mechanism is showed as follows.At low temperature or room temperature, the polymer material forms hydrogen bonds with water.When the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds are disrupted, while the hydrophobic effect of the material is enhanced, which is accompanied with the change of material aggregation into gel.The difference between room temperature and body temperature is used to ensure that the hydrogel can be delivered to the blood vessel of the tumor in a liquid form and can form solid state hydrogel under body temperature at the targeting tumor vascular site.In short, the temperaturesensitive hydrogel forming system not only has the advantages of being injectable and easy to use, but also might reduce the patient's pain during the treatment process.</p>
<h1>Acrylamide-Based Hydrogel</h1>
<p>In 1968, Heskins et al. first described the unique thermal behavior of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), <ref>Heskins, M and Guillet, J. J. Macromol. Sci., Part A: Pure Appl. Chem. 1968;2:1441.</ref> as this material enables transition from a liquid solution phase to a solidified gel phase at 32 C, and it becomes the most popular building block of temperature-induced in situ hydrogel materials.More interestingly, with copolymerization with N-propylacrylamide (NPAM), the poly(NIPAM-co-NPAM)</p>
<p>hydrogel have been successfully applied to vascular embolization in the renal artery of rabbits with no detectable acute toxicity, <ref>Li, X and Liu, W and Ye, G and Zhang, B and Zhu, D and Yao, K and Liu, Z and Sheng, X. Biomaterials. 2005;26:7002.</ref> which was confirmed by experimental angiography and histology inspection.</p>
<p>It is also worthy to mentioned that the PNIPAm hydrogel prepared by redox polymerization is too weak and brittle. <ref>Haq, M and Su, Y and Wang, D. Mater. Sci. Eng., C. 2017;70:842.</ref>ne of the reasons is the density of oligomers in the swollen state. <ref>Takigawa, T and Yamawaki, T and Takahashi, K and Masuda, T. Polym. Gels Networks. 1998;5:585.</ref>The simple way to overcome the problem is to incorporating other polymers into the hydrogel substrate, for enhanced mechanical property. <ref>Takigawa, T and Yamawaki, T and Takahashi, K and Masuda, T. Polym. Gels Networks. 1998;5:585.</ref><ref>Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Wang, Q and Fang, J and Zhou, G and Zhao, H and Yang, Y and Xu, H and Feng, G and Yang, X. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2011;:2035.</ref><ref>Shi, X and Gao, H and Dai, F and Feng, X and Liu, W. Biomater. Sci. 2016;4:1673.</ref> As a typical example, Li et al. synthesized a series of thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm)-N-propylacrylamide (NPAAm)-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) terpolymers (PNINAVP) with different feeding ratios, and analyzed their thermal response behavior.With the increase of NPAAM, the area of hydrophobic group increased, which led to the decrease of LCST.The shear viscosity of the copolymer solution with a higher NPAAm content was increased by more than 100 times, and the shear modulus was uniformly increased by more than 1000 times.The addition of VP strengthened the bond with iohexol, which prevented the leakage of embolism and reduced its toxic or side effects while realizing the visualization of embolism.Subsequently, a cerebral arteriovenous malformation model was constructed, and 1-2 mL of PNINAVP solution was injected through a microcatheter for successful embolization.Interestingly, within one month after embolization, no recanalization of blood vessels was observed, indicating the importance of polymeric hydrogel structure for long term embolization. <ref>Li, X and Liu, W and Ye, G and Zhang, B and Zhu, D and Yao, K and Liu, Z and Sheng, X. Biomaterials. 2005;26:7002.</ref>For another case, Zhao et al. developed an ultra-stable temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamideco-butyl methylacrylate) or PIB hydrogel.Although the phase transition temperature of PNIPAM hydrogel was 32.9 C, this unique PIB hydrogel underwent a swelling gel, a flowable sol, a shrinking gel, or a triple phase state, with the temperature   3A).Furthermore, 14 d after embolizing the blood vessels supplying rabbit liver VX2 cancer with Lipiodol and PIB, it was found that the PIB showed a greater degree of tumor necrosis and fewer metastatic foci, indicating the promising application of using temperature sensitive hydrogel as TAE treatment materials for liver tumor therapy. <ref>Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Wang, Q and Fang, J and Zhou, G and Zhao, H and Yang, Y and Xu, H and Feng, G and Yang, X. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2011;:2035.</ref>Last but not least, Li et al. evaluated the advantages of PIB in tumor collateral circulation and vascular recanalization after TAE treatment.The design of polymeric structures to increase the mechanical property in gel phase will led to the complete embolism of all eight levels of microchannels from 20 to 800 m, which is an in vitro mimic model of tumor vasculature with microfluidic chips (Figure 3B).It is also worthy to mention that Lipiodol could accomplish embolization of eight channels due to its good fluidity, but the embolization continued only a short duration under the washing saline buffer solution.Tight embolization created a powerful "starvation" treatment Figure 3.

<p>condition, produced embolization of tumor vessels at all sizes of vessels, effectively avoiding the up-regulation of HIF-1, VEGF, and CD31 caused by local hypoxia (Figure 3C).Compared with Ivalon and Lipiodol, PIB could effectively limit the formation of new blood vessels and collateral circulation. <ref>Li, L and Liu, Y and Li, H and Guo, X and He, X and Geng, S and Zhao, H and Peng, X and Shi, D and Xiong, B and Zhou, G and Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Yang, X.

ACS Macro Lett. 2013;2:597.</ref>For example, thermal responsive poly(N-acryloylglycinamide) or PNAGA was designed with high strength and UCST to show its ability to form a stable solid hydrogel as the temperature decreases, indicating the promising future of acrylamide-based hydrogel in TAE. <ref>Shi, X and Gao, H and Dai, F and Feng, X and Liu, W. Biomater. Sci. 2016;4:1673.</ref></p>
<h1>Silk Fibroin</h1>
<p>As the mechanical property of hydrogel is important for TAE, silk-elastin-like proteins (SELPs), with good mechanical performance and temperature responsiveness, have been popularly incorporated into the building block of the polymeric hydrogels.SELPs are composed of silkworm silk and mammalian elastin units found in repetitive blocks of naturally occurring proteins.Their phase change occurs at 37 C, while the elastin unit collapses thermodynamically, leading to a filamentous unit, hydrogen-bonded  sheet, and a physically cross-linked matrix formation. <ref>Poursaid, A and Jensen, M and Nourbakhsh, I and Weisenberger, M and Hellgeth, J and Sampath, S and Cappello, J and Ghandehari, H. Mol. Pharmaceutics. 2016;13:2736.</ref><ref>Gustafson, J and Ghandehari, H. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2010;62:1509.</ref>Poursaid with his colleagues designed SELP-47K and SELP-815K with different molecular weight.It had been confirmed that shearing processing, the viscosity, stiffness, gelation speed, swelling rate, and drug loading of SELP might be well adjusted by changing the sequence of the starting material ratios.The sheared 12% w/w SELP-815K was screened out for embolization through the microfluidic device simulating in vitro vascular embolism.The gel stiffness of the sheared 12% w/w SELP-815K at 5 min is ten times than that of the sheared 12% w/w SELP-47K.In vivo evaluation further proved that this SELP-815K formulation could effectively block the blood supply to the rabbit hepatic artery.Histological examination proves the embolic ability of SELP, and venous blood was not discharged through the central vein into the systemic circulation, indicating the successful application of SELP based hydrogel formulation in TAE. <ref>Poursaid, A and Price, R and Tiede, A and Olson, E and Huo, E and Mcgill, L and Ghandehari, H and Cappello, J. Biomaterials. 2015;57:142.</ref></p>
<h1>Thermosensitive Material Based on Polysaccharides</h1>
<p>Besides to the previous mentioned acrylamide and silk fibroin based polymeric hydrogel, natural polysaccharide (i.e., chitosan) could also serve as a good candidate due to its high biocompatibility and high tissue adhesion ability.As a typical example, Sun et al. studied the potential of thermally responsive hydroxybutyl chitosan (HBC) hydrogel for selective vascular occlusion, and introduced hydroxybutyl into the chitosan framework to render good hydrophilicity and fast sol-gel transition.After the HBC solution was injected into the renal artery of the rat, the HBC solution was converted into a hydrogel and adhered tightly to the inner wall of the blood vessel, which immediately embolized the blood vessel.At the same time, erythrocytes could accumulate around the hydrogel and slightly coagulate, avoiding free migration of the hydrogel in the blood. <ref>Sun, G and Feng, C and Jiang, C and Zhang, T and Bao, Z and Zuo, Y and Kong, M and Cheng, X and Liu, Y and Chen, X. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2017;105:566.</ref>Although chitosan with high adhesion ability to blood vessel could be potential for TAE application, pure chitosan solution is sensitive to pH and might form precipitation with environmental pH above 6.2.In order to solve this problem, -glycerophosphate disodium salt (-GP) was utilized to form the complex of chitosan/-GP, which can be flowable in the physiological pH at low temperature, and turn into a gel at body temperature in a thermally responsive manner. <ref>Coutu, J.-M and Fatimi, A and Berrahmoune, S and Soulez, G and Lerouge, S. J. Biomed. Mater. Res., Part B. 2013;101:153.</ref>In details, a liquid consisting of 2% chitosan and 56% -GP was prepared as an embolic agent.During the eight-week observation period, this liquid agent completely blocked the rabbit's renal artery without recanalization.There was no catheter obstruction or non-target embolism. <ref>Wang, Y and Xu, N and Luo, Q and Li, Y and Sun, L and Wang, H and Xu, K and Wang, B and Zhen, Y. Interv. Radiol. 2011;17:87.</ref>Based on this exciting finding, a trackable embolic system composed of chitosan, -GP, and Visipaque (X-ray contrast reagent) was developed for acute embolization of porcine spleen and gastric vessels. <ref>Hu, J and Albadawi, H and Chong, B and Deipolyi, A and Sheth, R and Khademhosseini, A and Oklu, R. Adv. Mater. 2019;31:1901071.</ref>Besides to chitosan based formulation, other type of polysaccharides such as acetylated poly-N-acetylglucosamine could also exhibit a polymerized gel-like behavior at physiological pH and temperature, which has been successfully utilized to embolize the rat renal artery. <ref>Kang, Q and An, Y and Moreira, P and Demcheva, M and Vournakis, J. Anat. Rec., Part A. 2005;284:454.</ref>In short, rationally designed polysaccharides with high biocompatibility and blood vessel adhesion ability could also be helpful in designing polymeric hydrogel for effective TAE.</p>
<h1>Thermosensitive Composite Hydrogel of Poloxamer 407 and Alginate</h1>
<p>Poloxamer (poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(propylene glycol)poly(ethylene glycol)) 407 is a temperature sensitive triblock copolymer that has been included in the United States Pharmacopoeia.It could experience a sol-to-gel transition upon the temperature increase from 4 to 37 C.More interestingly, Raymond et al. has verified the temporary embolic characteristics of this material in the arteries of animals, while unfortunately it will soon cause the recanalization of blood vessels. <ref>Raymond, J and Metcalfe, A and Salazkin, I and Schwarz, A. Biomaterials. 2004;25:3983.</ref>In order to strengthen its mechanical properties and achieve a longer embolization.Another thermosensitive composite hydrogel based on poloxamer 407, sodium alginate, hydroxymethyl cellulose, iodixanol, and Ca 2+ (PSHI-Ca 2+ ) was prepared.Alginate was added into Poloxamer 407 to increase the retention rate of Ca ions, and formed a stable 3D structure to prevent the erosion of hydrogel in the water environment.PSHI material can be recanalized within 30 min, while PSHI-Ca 2+ hydrogel had a good blocking effect within 7 d and achieved outstanding curative effect in rabbit VX2 liver tumors. <ref>Huang, L and Shen, M and Li, R and Zhang, X and Sun, Y and Gao, P and Fu, H and Liu, H and He, Y and Du, Y and Cao, J and Duan, Y. Oncotarget. 2016;7:73280.</ref></p>
<h1>pH-Sensitive Hydrogel Materials</h1>
<p>Although the temperature responsive hydrogel is a good candidate for TAE, its injection time should be carefully designed to prevent the early gel formation.In this case, other physiological factor (i.e., pH) sensitive formulation could also be important for the design of TAE hydrogel.The pH-sensitive hydrogel material usually realizes the change of hydrophilic and hydrophobic state in response to the difference of environmental pH.</p>
<p>Compared with the temperature-sensitive embolization system, the pH trigger material can be transported in liquid form to achieve gelation in the target blood vessel environment pH, without the need of injection time consideration.As a typical example, pH-sensitive hydrogel based on sulfamethazine (SM) has been proposed for vascular interventional therapy, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyurethane sulfide sulfamethazine (PUSSM) copolymer (PEG-PUSSM); <ref>Nguyen, Q and Lee, M and Lym, J and Kim, Y and Jae, H and Lee, D. J. Mater. Chem. B. 2016;4:6524.</ref> PCL-PEG-SM composed of poly(-caprolactone) (PCL), SM, and PEG; <ref>Lym, J and Nguyen, Q and Ahn, D and Huynh, C and Jae, H and Kim, Y and Lee, D. Acta Biomater. 2016;41:253.</ref> and the copolymer made of triblock poly(-caprolactone-co-lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(-caprolactone-co-lactide) (PCLA-PEG-PCLA) and SM. <ref>Nguyen, Q and Lym, J and Huynh, C and Kim, B and Jae, H and Kim, Y and Lee, D. Polym. Chem. 2016;7:5805.</ref>When the sulfadimethazine in the ionized state of high pH is exposed to physiological pH, the decrease of pH causes the deionization of SM, which changes from the hydrophilic state to the hydrophobic state and forms a 3D gel network.Due to this unique pH sensitive property, PEG-PUSSM hydrogel achieved good performance in both renal vasculature embolization and rabbit liver embolization. <ref>Nguyen, Q and Lee, M and Lym, J and Kim, Y and Jae, H and Lee, D. J. Mater. Chem. B. 2016;4:6524.</ref>It should be emphasized that PEG-PUSSM could achieve effective embolization in the renal artery for even up to 32 d.Besides to SM's based pH sensitivity, poly(amino ester urethane) (PAEU) block copolymer synthesized by Huynh et al. had also been confirmed to respond to temperature and pH, and was demonstrated to form hydrogels along the hepatic artery, indicating the potentials of using pH-sensitive hydrogel in TAE. <ref>Huynh, C and Nguyen, Q and Lym, J and Kim, B and Jae, H and Kim, Y and Lee, D. RSC Adv. 2016;6:47687.</ref></p>
<h1>Chemical Crosslinking Hydrogel Materials</h1>
<p>In addition to previously mentioned physical crosslinking hydrogels with temperature or pH sensitivity, in situ chemical crosslinking hydrogels with stable crossing network could also be utilized for vessel embolization.In comparison with physical crosslinking gels with long forming time and weak mechanical strength, chemical crosslinking formulation might generate fast gelation and firm structure.The chemical crosslinking system for vascular embolization are mainly based on Schiff base reaction, <ref>Zhou, X and Li, Y and Chen, S and -N.

Sci. Rep. 2016;6:32145.</ref> etc.As a typical example, Zhou et al. developed a chitosan-based hydrogel with dynamic self-healing ability, which is composed of biocompatible glycol chitosan, an antibleeding carbazochrome, and dibenzaldehyde-terminated PEG.The benzaldehyde modified PEG reacted quickly with the amine group of chitosan to form imine bonds.In this cross-linking system, the uncoupling and recoupling of imine bonds provided self-repairing properties and realized the potential adjustable ability of carbazochrome to control hemostatic release. <ref>Zhou, X and Li, Y and Chen, S and -N.

<h1>Other Forms of Crosslinking Materials</h1>
<p>Besides to temperature, pH, or chemical based crosslinking strategies, electrostatic interaction might also be utilized to form hydrogel.For example, alginate is a natural polysaccharide that is able to cross link with ions to form hydrogel.It is caused by the synergistic binding of divalent cations to the G-block region of this unique polymer.Calcium alginate cross-linking networks have been reported for vascular embolism, <ref>Fan, L and Duan, M and Xie, Z and Pan, K and Wang, X and Sun, X and Wang, Q and Rao, W and Liu, J.

<h1>Multi-Functionality of Intravascular Transarterial Embolization Hydrogel</h1>
<h1>Optimized Injectability</h1>
<p>The injection performance of hydrogel is required for successful TAE.In details, the internal environment during treatment is complicated without regular shapes.In order to prevent premature gel formation causing catheter adhesion, the hydrogel should be injected into the blood vessel before gel formation, and it should not be washed away by blood flow.No matter that it is physical cross-linking (i.e., temperaturesensitive hydrogel) or chemical cross-linking, the best injection time should be carefully evaluated to achieve the optimal gel forming conditions in the blood vessel.Zhao et al. found that the hydrogel dispersion temperature difference (T) between pre-injection and the body temperature was closely related to the gelation time.By changing the temperature before injection, the gelation time could be tuned to avoid too fast gelation for blood vessel blockage, or to prevent too long gelation time which might induce undesired hydrogel dispersion in the target blood vessel and lead to false embolism. <ref>Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Wang, Q and Fang, J and Zhou, G and Zhao, H and Yang, Y and Xu, H and Feng, G and Yang, X. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2011;:2035.</ref>n order to solve the problem of injection time, hydrogel with shear-thinning properties has been designed.By taking the advantage of shear-thinning property, the physician could be with the freedom to deliver embolism reagents and does not require special conveying tools in standard surgery process, without considering the threat of blockage in catheter owing to their potential adhesion characteristics.As a typical example, Steele et al. developed a strong and reversible 3D hydrogel network made of PEG-PLA nanoparticles and hyaluronic acid (HA) as cross-linker, which exhibited shear thinning or selfhealing properties and was able to be transported through elongated long catheters.Interestingly, the injectability of the hydrogel was evaluated and the experimental results showed the hydrogel could be easily injected through a syringe (31-G) or catheter.Furthermore, once it was deposited on the glass slide, its solid state could immediately recovered upon coming out of the needle. <ref>Steele, A and Stapleton, L and Farry, J and Lucian, H and Paulsen, M and Eskandari, A and Hironaka, C and Thakore, A and Wang, H and Yu, A and Chan, D and Appel, E and Woo, Y.

Healthcare Mater. 2019;8:1801147.</ref>For another example, Avery et al. engineered a physically cross-linked nanocomposite hydrogel as a shear-thinning biomaterial (STB), through strong electrostatic interaction between gelatin and silicate nanoplatelets (Figure 4A,B). <ref>Avery, R and Albadawi, H and Akbari, M and Zhang, Y and Duggan, M and Sahani, D and Olsen, B and Khademhosseini, A and Oklu, R. Sci. Transl. Med. 2016;8:365-156.</ref>The injectability of the hydrogel was evaluated and showed in Figure 4C.The rheological experimental results showed that the shear thinning behavior of STB could be maintained, even without the flow application for a long time (Figure 4D).In details, the application of high strain would lead to rapid drop of the shear storage modulus (G) and remain a liquid-like state, while the removal of strain could restore the solid phase behavior of STB.By using laser Doppler microperfusion and digital subtraction angiography imaging, it was showed that STB could completely block the vasculature of mice and pigs in vivo, and remain intact at the injection site.And no pulmonary embolism due to rupture or displacement of the embolic agent was observed even in the forelimb veins embolization, indicating the unique advantages of STB in vascular embolism. <ref>Avery, R and Albadawi, H and Akbari, M and Zhang, Y and Duggan, M and Sahani, D and Olsen, B and Khademhosseini, A and Oklu, R.

<h1>Chemotherapy Drugs Loading</h1>
<p>The use of embolization alone to treat tumors is named as bland embolization, whose treatment effect could be improved with the assistance of chemotherapy.In this case, it is necessary to combine TAE with local chemotherapy, which is named as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).TACE has both anti-tumor chemotherapy with cytotoxicity effect and arterial embolization that stops the tumor blood supply and lead to treatment tissue necrosis of targeted tissue.Hence, TACE could increase the local drug concentration in the target lesion, thereby reducing the systemic side effects associated with the chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>
<p>For example, after validation of the vascular embolization potential of SELP, <ref>Poursaid, A and Price, R and Tiede, A and Olson, E and Huo, E and Mcgill, L and Ghandehari, H and Cappello, J. Biomaterials. 2015;57:142.</ref> Poursaid group continued to combine tumor starvation embolization with local delivery or sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents, in term of HCl doxorubicin (DOX) or sorafenib mesylate, for enhanced tumor treatment.For another case, based on PEG-PUSSM hydrogel with renal vasculature system and rabbit liver embolization ability, <ref>Nguyen, Q and Lee, M and Lym, J and Kim, Y and Jae, H and Lee, D.

Acta Biomater. 2016;41:253.</ref>More interestingly, the released adriamycin showed bioactive levels which were comparable to free adriamycin, and PCLA-PUSSM showed chemical embolization with a 48% reduction in tumor volume within 2 weeks after injection, indicating the advantage of TACE. <ref>Nguyen, Q and Lym, J and Huynh, C and Kim, B and Jae, H and Kim, Y and Lee, D. Polym. Chem. 2016;7:5805.</ref></p>
<h1>Trackable Ability</h1>
<p>Besides to the previous mentioned injectability and the ability to co-load chemotherapeutic drugs, the trackable ability of hydrogel is also important for TAE application.For embolization, iodide, which could be easily trapped in hydrogel network, is one of the most commonly used contrast agents in clinical practice. <ref>Li, X and Liu, W and Ye, G and Zhang, B and Zhu, D and Yao, K and Liu, Z and Sheng, X.

Chem. 2016;7:5805.</ref>For example, Zhao et al. developed a novel temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methylacrylate) (PIB) hydrogel with incorporation of iohexol for successful visualization of embolization process. <ref>Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Wang, Q and Fang, J and Zhou, G and Zhao, H and Yang, Y and Xu, H and Feng, G and Yang, X. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2011;:2035.</ref>However, it is worth mentioned that iodinated compounds have a significant effect on the sol-gel behavior, increasing the difficulty and risk of operation.Furthermore, the iodide contrast agent loaded in the hydrogel might be rapidly metabolized in the body, showing poor long-term imaging performance. <ref>Li, L and Liu, Y and Li, H and Guo, X and He, X and Geng, S and Zhao, H and Peng, X and Shi, D and Xiong, B and Zhou, G and Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Yang, X.

J. Mater. Chem. B. 2014;2:6044.</ref>or another case, Fan et al. prepared a radiopaque hydrogel system based on liquid metal for the first time (Figure 5A).The hydrogel can be generated by rapid cross-linking between liquid metal/calcium alginate mixture solution and calcium chloride solution.Liquid metal is a low melting point metal near room temperature with the advantages of radiocapacity, low viscosity, and fluidity to ensure its injectability.In this case, it has advantages in X-ray tracing imaging compared with currently commercial contrast reagents to its high density (Figure 5B,C).Its efficacy and safety had been well documented in vivo through mouse blood tests.Throughout nearly a month of monitoring, it was found that the blood vessels were still embolized without obvious inflammation or infection.In the end, these materials had been successfully applied in the embolization of rabbit ear tumors by blocking the middle artery to block blood flow into the tumor.The tumor was effectively suppressed or resolved in two weeks. <ref>Fan, L and Duan, M and Xie, Z and Pan, K and Wang, X and Sun, X and Wang, Q and Rao, W and Liu, J. Small. 2020;16:1903421.</ref>urthermore, a dual-function embolization visualization system with fluorescence imaging guided tumor excision was proposed.For the removal of tumors with high blood vessels, there might be a lot of bleeding during the operation, which might cover up the field of vision, or affect the doctor's judgment on the location of the tumor as well as the therapeutic effects.In order to solve this issue, indocyanine green (ICG) was bound tightly to globular proteins such as albumin, which is a higher content in tumor tissues and could preferentially accumulate in the blood vessels of tumor tissues for showing a clear-cut boundary. <ref>Alander, J and Kaartinen, I and Laakso, A and Patila, T and Spillmann, T and Tuchin, V and Venermo, M and Valisuo, P. Int. J. Biomed. Imaging. 2012;:940585.</ref>Furthermore, the short halflife (3-5 min) of ICG could be overcome by local delivery of ICG and blood flow restriction in the tumor, with the design of adding ICG to SELPs. <ref>Chen, H and Cheng, H and Dai, Q and Cheng, Y and Zhang, Y and Li, D and Sun, Y and Mao, J and Ren, K and Chu, C and Liu, G.

<h1>External Vascular Embolization Regulated by Internal Stress in Hydrogel</h1>
<p>With addition to simple embolization, a novel blood vessel starvation could also be achieved by internal stress induced vascular obstruction, which was caused by extravascular gelation contraction.As a typical example, Zhang et al. synthesized a composite hydrogel made of gold nano-rod (GNR) and temperature sensitive pNIPAAm based polymer. <ref>Zhang, K and Fang, Y and He, Y and Yin, H and Guan, X and Pu, Y and Zhou, B and Yue, W and Ren, W and Du, D and Li, H and Liu, C and Sun, L and Chen, Y and Xu, H. Nat. Commun. 2019;10:5380.</ref>Upon 808 nm laser irradiation, GNR might generate heat and lead to internal stress increase of this composite hydrogel, which could further compress and shrink blood vessels for effective nutrient supply blockage.Experimentally, in vivo vascular compression was studied using the color Doppler flow imaging technique, and in vivo perfusion studies were performance by using FITC-labeled dextran of different sizes.More interestingly, the chelation of GNR in pNIPAAm hydrogel could significantly improve its mechanical stiffness, as pNIPAAm gel was with unsatisfactory or poor internal stresses.Hence, this composite hydrogel with compact structure and strong internal stress were successful in tumor starvation treatment.</p>
<h1>Thrombogenic Activators Loaded Nanomaterials Mediated Vascular Obstruction for Cancer Therapy</h1>
<p>Embolization has been proposed for clinical treatment for a long time, but the traditional embolic agents have various drawbacks, which hinder the popularization of this treatment strategy in liver cancer treatment.Although in situ hydrogel-mediated transarterial embolization can greatly improve the efficacy of solid tumors such as liver cancer, but it may cause multiple complications and should not be used for cancer of some cavity organs such as bowel and bladder.Furthermore, considering the complexity of the surgical procedure, it is necessary to find a new type of safe and effective biological embolic agent.Compared with in situ hydrogel-mediated transarterial embolization, another hopeful tumor vascular blocking strategy involving nanotherapeutic agents that induce tumor cell death by specifically blocking tumor supply has been proposed.This strategy, which involves targeted embolization through intravenous injection, is expected to be a more promising alternative to transarterial vascular embolization owing to its simple, non-surgical treatment and its applicability to a wider range of tumors.</p>

<h1>Thrombin Loaded Nanomaterials Delivery Strategy</h1>
<p>Considering the possible off-target properties and weak coagulation abilities of CREKA peptides targeted nanoplatform based on thrombin, which exhibits a stronger tumor embolic effect through directly and efficiently activating platelets and hydrolyzing fibrinogen into fibrin to induce a stronger clotting response, has been proposed in recent years.In details, thrombin was capable of activating platelets and simultaneously converting fibrinogen in the blood circulation into fibrin to regulate platelet aggregation, ultimately leading to the formation of blockage clots. <ref>Sambrano, G and Weiss, E and Zheng, Y and Huang, W and Coughlin, S. Nature. 2001;413:74.</ref>However, bare thrombin has a very limited lifespan in the circulatory system and may indiscriminately induce clotting events, making it unavailable for direct cancer therapy.To overcome this drawback and achieve targeting ability, nanomaterials (i.e., DNA nanorobot <ref>Li, S and Jiang, Q and Liu, S and Zhang, Y and Tian, Y and Song, C and Wang, J and Zou, Y and Anderson, G and Han, J and Chang, Y and Liu, Y and Zhang, C and Chen, L and Zhou, G and Nie, G and Yan, H and Ding, B and Zhao, Y.

Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020;4:732.</ref> ) were proposed for precise delivery to the tumor site in a highly regulated manner to minimize its impact on healthy tissue.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that nucleolin is a specifically expressed protein on tumor-related ECs. <ref>Huang, Y and Shi, H and Zhou, H and Song, X and Yuan, S and Luo, Y. Blood. 2006;107:3564.</ref>Li et al. constructed a DNA nanorobot system via self-assembling origami nanotubes with multifunctional elements (Figure 6A,B).The rectangular DNA origami with dimensions of 90 nm  60 nm  2 nm was prepared, followed by anchored thrombin-DNA conjugates, which was combined by poly-T oligonucleotides with thrombin under a cross-linker.The tubular DNA nanorobots could be further formed by adding a Y-shape fastener structure and a targeting strand (AS1411 adaptor sequence) used both as a nucleolin targeting structure and a key component for responsive release.Once it was recognized in tumor vascular, the hybridized duplex would disconjugate, accompanied by the conformation change of nanorobots and exposure of the contained thrombin to induce thrombosis.In short, thrombin loaded nanorobots are able to achieve tumor vascular infarction and targeting tumor therapy in vivo. <ref>Li, S and Jiang, Q and Liu, S and Zhang, Y and Tian, Y and Song, C and Wang, J and Zou, Y and Anderson, G and Han, J and Chang, Y and Liu, Y and Zhang, C and Chen, L and Zhou, G and Nie, G and Yan, H and Ding, B and Zhao, Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2018;36:258.</ref>owever, the high production cost of DNA nanostructures may limit the clinical application currently.Furthermore, coagulation embolism nanotherapies alone can hardly eradicate tumors because tumors are capable of obtaining nutrients and regenerating from surviving tumor marginal tissues.For this reason, through introducing chemotherapeutic drugs, the team further established a low-cost nanotherapy that combined tumor infarction therapy with chemotherapy.The chitosanbased nanoparticles, decorated with CREKA peptides, additionally encapsulated the coagulation-inducing protease thrombin and DOX to achieve optimal therapy.It's worth mentioned that compared with the treatment of vascular infarction alone, the systemic use of nanoparticles could achieve a higher therapeutic effect, rapid tumor elimination recurrence. <ref>Li, S and Zhang, Y and Ho, S and Li, B and Wang, M and Deng, X and Yang, N and Liu, G and Lu, Z and Xu, J and Shi, Q and Han, J and Zhang, L and Wu, Y and Zhao, Y and Nie, G. Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2020;4:732.</ref></p>
<h1>Fibrinogen Nanoplatform Based Self-Expanding Coagulation System</h1>
<p>It is noteworthy that specific embolism based on CREKA or thrombin may be quickly cleared by enzymes in the body after formation.In order to create long-term and high-strength embolization, a self-amplification delivery of nanoparticles referring to effective signal amplification and positive feedback properties was proposed.As a typical example, multi-walled carbon nanotubes modified by PEG (CMWNTs-PEG) conjugated with the CREKA peptide were developed, integrating photothermal effect and tumor vascular targeting characteristics, which damaged the tumor blood vessels.NIR irradiation caused more blood vessel coagulation, and further attracted the aggregation of CMWNTs-PEG.Continuous PTT triggered persistent generation of fibrin to embed more CMWNTs-PEG, leading to coagulation positive feedback. <ref>Zhang, B and Wang, H and Shen, S and She, X and Shi, W and Chen, J and Zhang, Q and Hu, Y and Pang, Z and Jiang, X. Biomaterials. 2016;79:46.</ref>n order to achieve stronger crosslinking, Zhang's research group reported a coagulation system.An artificial ECM (aECM) based on fibrinogen and thrombin was constructed to block the supply of specific nutrients (Figure 6C).The fibrinogen was modified with azido (Fb-N3) and prothrombin was grafted with azodibenzocyclooctyne (Ptb-DBCO).Once Fb-N3 was injected, the microwounds formed by surgery, RT or ultrasound treatment would trigger the specific accumulation of Fb-N3 in the tumor site.Subsequent absorption of Ptb-DBCO created bioorthogonal reaction between DBCO and N3 group, and further caused intravascular gelatinization.The dense structure in the hydrogel would limit the diffusion of molecules.Significantly, the gels were capable of selective molecular diffusion without cutting off oxygen supply for improving tumor cells hypoxia, but the nutrient intake of cancer cells was inhibited, which was never mentioned before.In short, aECM could cause tumorspecific starvation while acting as a physical barrier to the spread of cancer cells into the circulatory system. <ref>Zheng, D and Hong, S and Zhang, Q and Dong, X and Pan, P and Song, W and Song, W and Cheng, S and Zhang, X. Nat. Commun. 2020;11:4907.</ref></p>
<h1>Artificial Platelet Clots</h1>
<p>In addition to drawing on the principle of cross-linking between thrombin and fibrin to form a gel, the activity of platelets in the coagulation process also aroused exploration.For example, platelet-like nanoparticles (pNPs) based on the peptide (BP-FFVLK-AHKHVHHVPVRL) was successfully developed for artificial clots construction in tumor blood vessels.The pNPs had three functional modules (Figure 7A), including the hydrophobic bis-pyrene (BP), FFVLK sequences, and AHKHVHHVPVRL peptide, which were linked by peptide bonds to achieve convenient monitoring of in vivo distribution, ECs activation, and mutually recognizing for assembly, <ref>Luo, Q and Lin, Y and Yang, P and Wang, Y and Qi, G and Qiao, Z and Li, B and Zhang, K and Zhang, J and Wang, L and Wang, H.

<h1>Artificial Vascular Clots with Deoxygenation Therapy</h1>
<p>Although vascular blockage was treated for blocking the nutrition and oxygen supply of tumor cells, its efficiency in inducing tumor hypoxia was not enough.To produce extreme hypoxia at the tumor and enhance the therapeutic effect, deoxidizers were introduced in strategies.Zhang et al. reported that Mg 2 Si nanoparticles (MS NPs) (Figure 7D) modified with polyvinylpyrrolidone were used as qualified deoxidizers to achieve specific deoxygenation tumor therapy (Figure 7C,D). <ref>Zhang, C and Ni, D and Liu, Y and Yao, H and Bu, W and Shi, J.

<p>products containing Mg 2+ , H 2 O, and SiO 2 showed good biocompatibility.Significantly, the content of O 2 dropped sharply after ten minutes of MS NPs injection and retained for three hours, which presented almost completely elimination of O 2 after MS NPs treatment, indicating that the effective deoxygenation of nanoparticles could achieve tumor treatment effects.</p>
<p>As new perspectives in oncology treatment, self-coagulation embolization nanotechnology has been designed for cutting off nutrient supply, including: 1) nanomaterials loading tumor vascular homing peptide and endogenous coagulation active ingredients, 2) in situ construction of platelet-like nanoclot, and 3) exogenous embolic aggregation, representing promising modalities of cancer treatment.In comparison with interventional embolization, the biggest advantage of self-coagulation embolization therapy is that the specific blockage of tumor vessels can be achieved through systemic drug delivery, without the need to rely on sophisticated surgical techniques.However, the greatest focus of intravenous drug delivery strategies remains on minimizing off-target toxicity, which can be achieved with smart nanomaterials.In short, by targeting the vasculature, modifying with coagulation peptides and loading endogenous coagulation-active peptides, various clots are designed utilizing the coagulation mechanism to propose new insights into tumor therapy.</p>
<h1>Anti-Vascular Agents Delivering Nanotherapy for Tumor Vasculature Functional Blocking</h1>
<p>In addition to blood vessels embolization by exogenous agents, anti-vascular drugs also have talent to block the delivery of nutrients to the tumor vessels.Currently, anti-vascular agents (i.e., AIAs, VDAs) have been approved for clinical cancer treatment, while the convenience and efficacy of these therapies can be further improved by biomaterials <ref>Shenoi, M and Iltis, I and Choi, J and Koonce, N and Metzger, G and Griffin, R and Bischof, J.

<h1>Monotherapy Combined with Chemotherapy</h1>
<p>Chemotherapy drugs are still the most direct and common treatment means for tumor therapy, which can kill tumor peripheral cells with rich blood vessels.Meanwhile, anti-vascular drugs mainly lead to tumor necrosis by inhibiting or destroying tumor blood vessels.The combination of these two therapeutic strategies has also been widely demonstrated to be feasible by many studies, which will be discussed below.</p>
<h1>Combination Therapy of Co-Loading Anti-Vascular Agents and Chemotherapy Agents</h1>
<p>In addition to the traditional tumor necrosis effect, the mechanism of chemotherapy drugs (i.e., DOX, camptothecin) has also been reported in the study of anti-angiogenesis.Take a typical example, polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles co-loaded with DOX and mitomycin C had been applied in multiple drugs drug-resistant human breast tumor xenografts treatment, which besides significantly improved tumor necrosis, also showed the potential in anti-tumor angiogenesis due to the inhibition of hypoxia inducing factor (HIF1) transcription by DOX. <ref>Prasad, P and Shuhendler, A and Cai, P and Rauth, A and Wu, X.

<h1>VDA-Induced Amplification Strategy of Nanoparticles Targeting to Tumors</h1>
<p>Smarter drug delivery strategies are devised based on the fact that VDAs alter the tumor microenvironment.Alterations caused by VDAs about the expression of certain components, such as up-regulation of p32, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and degree of hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, can achieve enhancement of target properties (Figure 9A).Lin et al. used the tumor vascular selectively disrupting agent, omombulin, which was responsible for a local elevation of the stress-associated protein p32, to provide additional binding sites for p32-targeted nanoplatform in the system, enabling effective delivery with prototype imaging agents (magnetic fluorescent iron oxide nanoworms), and prototype therapeutic agents (lipid loaded with adriamycin), respectively (Figure 9B). <ref>Lin, K and Kwon, E and Lo, J and Bhatia, S.

<p>In addition to its direct tumor vasoconstriction effect, VDAs can also activate the immune response.As a typical example, the VDA nanomedicine composed of poly(L-glutamic acid)graft-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4 (CA4-NPs), was confirmed to be capable of inducing immature pDC to infiltrate the tumor.Hypoxia-sensitive imiquimod (hs-IMQ) was subsequently introduced for active immune system.Hs-IMQ could be catalyzed by CA4-NPs-induced nitroreductase into IMQ.Compared with hs-IMQ treatment alone, the combination of hs-IMQ and CA4-NPs could lead to a 6.3-fold increase in the active IMQ concentration in the tumor.Active IMQ changed the tumor microenvironment from an immunosuppressed state to an immune activated state by transforming immature pDC into its active form, resulting in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with strong infiltration ability in the tumor.The combined treatment of CA4-NP and hs-IMQ can synergistically inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, providing a new method to use VDA therapy for reversing the immunosuppressive effects. <ref>Shen, N and Wu, J and Yang, C and Yu, H and Yang, S and Li, T and Chen, J and Tang, Z and Chen, X.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Dramatic developments in tumor vascular blocking strategy have been witnessed in the past decades.Although therapy of TAE or anti-vascular agents have been endorsed for clinical trials, they are not currently a front-line treatment alternative.Recent progress in tumor therapy opens up highly promising alternatives for tumor vascular blocking strategies.We summarized the following three aspects: 1) hydrogels, undergoing chemically or physically induced water-gel transition, might physically embolize tumor vascular under the guidance of imaging technology.More importantly, hydrogel based strategy demonstrated lower toxicity and easier operation than solid embolic agents, while it has a stronger embolic effect in comparison with that of liquid embolic agents.Furthermore, by coloading with chemotherapeutic or trackable agents, hydrogel based embolism strategy could be combined with localized chemotherapy or even with real-time monitoring potentials for better theranostic designs; 2) biomaterials with biologically active molecules, including CREKA peptides, thrombin, pNPs, in situ SiO 2 aggregation, could selectively embolize tumor vessels by physical or biological coagulation.It is worth mentioned that this approach can achieve targeted embolization through intravenous injection merely, exhibiting easier delivery option and boarder applicability; 3) nanotechnology-mediated antivascular therapies, including angiogenesis inhibiting, tumor vascular disruption therapy, as well as multifunctional nanoplatforms integrated with chemotherapy, phototherapy, or immunotherapy, could also achieve superior therapeutic outcomes in comparison with monotherapy.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioned that, although therapies with vascular blocking/damaging capabilities open a door for novel tumor treatment approaches, vascular blockage/damage based cancer therapy still need further investigations.For example, although hydrogel-mediated embolization in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment could serve as a promising topical drug delivery strategy, the safety of hydrogel still needs to be thoroughly studied, in terms of histocompatibility, polymer metabolism kinetics, or biodistribution of embolic agents.On the aspect of therapeutic effect, the physical behavior of hydrogels should also be optimized in order to prevent easy dispersion by blood flow and to avoid ectopic embolization.Last but not least, ideal embolization hydrogel formulation should fit controllable degradation time accompanied by tumor shrinkage, to avoid side branch recanalization or excessive embolism.</p>
<p>In comparison with hydrogel formulation, nanoparticle designs with the ability to achieve functions of anti-vascular or selective tumor vessels embolization have showed operation convenience.Furthermore, unlike chemotherapy, nanoparticle based embolization targets tumor vascular sites without considering the difficult problem in tumor tissue penetration.Although the potential advantages of delivering drugs via targeted polymeric nanoparticles are relatively clear, the translation of targeted nanoparticles into clinical development still faces significant challenges.One issue that must be addressed is the suboptimal Figure 10.A) Schematic representation of the synthesis of RNAi-AuNPs.Reproduced with permission. <ref>Son, S and Kim, N and You, D and Yoon, H and Yhee, J and Kim, K and Kwon, I and Kim, S.

<p>targeting efficiency of therapeutic agents, which might cause unnecessary vascular damage.On the one hand, the biochemical microenvironment difference in different tumor models, the heterogeneity of vascular permeability, or even the interstitial fluid pressure might determine the size of therapeutic nanoparticles accumulated in the disease sties, which is quite unpredictable but significantly affect the targeting or aggregation capacity.Furthermore, intravenous drug delivery requires sufficiently high concentrations of nanoparticle materials for drug encapsulation, long circulation times, and sustained drug release, in order to improve drug's pharmacological behaviors (i.e., to optimize the metabolic kinetics, biodistribution, or tissue exposure kinetics of bioactive ingredients).In this case, a careful study on biophysical-chemical properties of nanoparticle materials as well as their drug encapsulation mechanism, and even the dosage of encapsulated anti-vascular active ingredients should be conducted, for maximum tumor vascular function obstruction with the least possible systemic toxicity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, biomaterials-mediated vascular blockade therapies focused on smart polymer hydrogel embolization agents, anti-vascular therapies, and bioactive nanoparticles through selective embolization of tumor vessels have been summarized.And it has been widely believed that the biomaterials-mediated vascular blockade therapies could play important role in localized tumor treatment.However, there are still some challenges in this field, including 1) to achieve nanomedicine designs with highly controllable targeting behaviors or vascular blockage monitoring; or 2) to seek robust and highly biocompatible biomaterials as embolization agents, without considering the complicated toxicity issue.Last but not least, it is hoped that the strategies summarized in this review could provide ideas for the future clinical translation of smart nanomedicines with the ability to target the tumor vascular system.</p>

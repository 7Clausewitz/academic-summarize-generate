<title level="a" type="main">Nanomaterial-Based Antivascular Therapy in the Multimodal Treatment of Cancer</title>
<abstract>Abnormal tumor vasculature and a hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) limit the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatment.Recent studies have shown that antivascular strategies that focus on antagonizing the hypoxic TME and promoting vessel normalization effectively synergize to increase the antitumor efficacy of conventional therapeutic regimens.By integrating multiple therapeutic agents, well-designed nanomaterials exhibit great advantages in achieving higher drug delivery efficiency and can be used as multimodal therapy with reduced systemic toxicity.In this review, strategies for the nanomaterial-based administration of antivascular therapy combined with other common tumor treatments, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, and interventional therapy, are summarized.In particular, the administration of intravascular therapy and other therapies with the use of versatile nanodrugs is also described.This review provides a reference for the development of multifunctional nanotheranostic platforms for effective antivascular therapy in combined anticancer treatments.</abstract>

<h1>Immunotherapy</h1>
<p>In recent years, immunotherapy has played a key role in tumor treatment, but its development is still hindered by many factors.Studies have shown that antivascular therapy can improve the immunosuppressive microenvironment and increase infiltration by immune effector cells.Table 1 describes existing combination antivascular therapy and immunotherapy strategies and the mechanisms of action of antivascular drugs; these strategies can achieve selective drug delivery and drug accumulation in the tumor microenvironment when combined with nanotherapy.CD8 + T cells play a crucial role in antitumor immunological therapy because of their direct antitumor cytotoxic function.Programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) is an immunosuppressive receptor located on T cells that can bind to programmed cell death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) located on stromal cells, inhibiting the activation of T cells and making them incapable of attacking.PD-L1 is highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibits the immune-killing function of CD8 + T cells.Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective as tumor treatment because they block the binding of PD-L1/PD-1.ICIs directly block the effect of PD-1 on CD8 + T cells, decreasing their proliferation <ref>Juneja, V and Mcguire, K and Manguso, R and Lafleur, M and Collins, N and Haining, W and Freeman, G and Sharpe, A.

<p>Vascular therapy combined with chemotherapy can effectively inhibit blood flow perfusion and decrease the high IFP, which promotes deep infiltration by the chemotherapeutic drugs into tumor tissues, targets tumor blood vessels to induce vessel normalization, prolongs TVN, and increases the delivery efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs.Antivascular drugs enhance chemotherapy sensitivity by inhibiting hematopoietic pathways.VDAs, in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, can target different cell populations within the tumor, leading to widespread tumor necrosis.Jain proposed a new concept, tumor vascular normalization (TVN), which can improve chemotherapy outcomes by reshaping the tumor microenvironment and enhancing drug delivery <ref>Martin, J and Seano, G and Jain, R. Normalizing Function of Tumor Vessels: Progress, Opportunities, and Challenges. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2019;81:505-534. doi:10.1146/annurev-physiol-020518-114700</ref>.However, a serious challenge currently facing chemotherapy is the transient effect of TVN, which presents challenges related to the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs in the TVN window.As a solution, we need to come up with new ways to keep the TVN effect going for a longer period of time.GBM neovascularization is primarily mediated by VEGF signaling, but alternative mechanisms, such as anaerobic glycolysis, can be quickly activated as a bypass.Li developed an anionic liposome nanosystem containing the chemotherapeutic drug topotecan (TPT), the sensitizer indocyanine green (ICG), and the antivascular drug erlotinib (ERL).ERL is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been found to be capable of normalizing the tumor vasculature by downregulating VEGF while inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).However, persistent anti-VEGF therapy leads to hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) upregulation, which eventually leads to the development of tumor hypoxia and drug resistance.Combination with the chemotherapeutic drug TPT can effectively prevent the production of HIF-1a and ultimately prolong TVN.ICG-mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) can reduce the expression of VEGF.This combination strategy can prolong TVN so that chemotherapeutic drugs can have longer-lasting effects on tumors (Figure 3B) <ref>Li, Y and Du, B and Cheng, G.

<p>VDAs cause the degradation of the basement membrane and ultimately induce the massive central necrosis of tumor tissue.Chemotherapeutic drugs are responsible for killing the tumor cells that proliferate around the lesion.The combination of a VDA and chemotherapeutic drugs has greater antitumor activity than either as a single agent, leading to extensive and broad tumor necrosis <ref>Cesca, M and Bizzaro, F and Zucchetti, M and Giavazzi, R.

<h1>Phototherapy</h1>
<p>Phototherapy for tumors mainly includes photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT).Studies have shown that the combination with antivascular therapy can overcome the problem of insufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with PDT therapy, and combination PTT therapy can increase the near-infrared absorption of tumors so that PTT therapy can kill tumor cells with less laser energy.Numerous studies have investigated the potential of combining antivascular therapy and phototherapy <ref>Kosharskyy, B and Solban, N and Chang, S and Rizvi, I and Chang, Y and Hasan, T.

<p>Vascular therapy combined with phototherapy can elicit anti-angiogenic effects to reverse the increase in VEGF seen after phototherapy, target blood vessels, and alleviate the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors to overcome the insufficient ROS production of PDT therapy.Some vascular targeting strategies can also increase the near-infrared absorption of tumors, enabling PTT to kill tumor cells with less laser energy.PTT converts light into thermal energy to kill tumor cells and is widely used in tumors because of its noninvasive nature and high efficacy <ref>[121]</ref>.The inefficient conversion of photosensitizer light into heat and poor photothermal stability make standalone PTT ineffective <ref>[122]</ref>.Zou added the anti-angiogenic drug sorafenib to T8IC, an organic semiconductor, using nanoprecipitation to form TS nanoparticles, which generated ROS with high photothermal conversion efficiency <ref>[118]</ref>.Li designed CuS-Ab NPs loaded with cetuximab to target EGFR to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth and to promote the accumulation of CuS NPs in tumors; these NPs reduce the laser energy required for PTT therapy and reduce damage to normal tissue <ref>[110]</ref>.Cyclic peptide c (RGDfk) can be administered in combination with integrin v3 to inhibit angiogenesis, and Liu constructed cRGD-modified glycolipid-like micelles (cRGD-CSOSA) to overcome the insufficient instability of ICG as a photosensitizer for phototherapy.The binding of cRGD-CSOSA/ICG nanoparticles promotes the production of ROS and improves the efficacy of phototherapy in GBM <ref>[112]</ref>.Hong bound fibrinogen to AuNPs to generate fAuNPs and used DMXAA to trigger the coagulation cascade in tumor blood vessels to induce the aggregation of fibrinogen.The fAuNPs could thus assemble into insoluble clots in the tumor blood vessels, and given that fAuNPs exhibit absorption peaks in the NIR spectrum, the strategy enhances the photothermal ablation induced by PTT.This combination therapy also reduces the side effects caused by the long-term administration of DMXAA, effectively destroying tumor blood vessels (Figure 4B) <ref>[115]</ref>.Liang co-delivered CA4 and Prussian blue (PB) in hydrogel for combination anticancer therapy and PTT to induce vascular rupture.PB is activated using near-infrared radiation to strongly attack most cancer cells, and CA4 limits the energy supply; this strategy overcomes inadequate tumor growth suppression due to limited laser penetration depth and provides proof of concept for the "attack + guard" strategy (Figure 4C) <ref>[109]</ref>.Zhang designed an MCNCD nanoparticle carrying a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (celecoxib) to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) from disrupting the PG2I/TXA2 balance, ultimately inducing intravascular thrombosis and reducing the risk of tumor metastasis after PTT treatment.Furthermore, MCNs have high photothermal conversion efficiency, which enhances the PTT effect [111].Gao's team developed a nanocarrier that uses near-infrared laser activation.After the near-infrared laser irradiation, the local temperature increase of the nanoparticles in the targeted tumor blood vessels causes the instant rupture of tumor vascular ECs, resulting in the destruction of neovascularization.Photothermal therapy and antivascular therapy are fused to induce the avascular necrosis of tumors in this study <ref>[117]</ref>.</p>

<h1>Radiation Therapy</h1>
<p>The role and status of radiation therapy in tumor treatment are becoming increasingly prominent, and radiation therapy has become one of the main therapeutic strategies for treating malignant tumors.Tumor hypoxia and high IFP in the microenvironment prevent drugs from easily reaching the tumor, contributing to radiological resistance <ref>[123,</ref><ref>124]</ref>.However, increasing the radiation dose and using radiosensitizers to enhance the effect of radiotherapy can increase toxicity in vivo and damage healthy tissues Zheng designed a heat-sensitive hydrogel (SOR-LUF-SeNPs) that can achieve the local and sustained release of sorafenib within tumors, and the combination of this hydrogel with chemoradiotherapy increased the apoptosis of HepG2 cells in the long-term treatment of HCC <ref>[131]</ref>.Wang and his team designed Au@SA-QBA, which produces 8HQ in response to H2O2; reduces the expression of VEGF, bFGF, and Ang-2; increases pericyclic-cell coverage and blood flow; normalizes tumor blood vessels; and significantly inhibits tumor growth in combination with radiotherapy <ref>[125]</ref>.Wang designed a hydrogel loaded with endothelial suppression (ES) that inhibits neovascularization by modulating receptors of angiogenesis factors on the cell membrane, alleviating tumor hypoxia, increasing perfusion to improve drug delivery efficiency, and increasing radiotherapy sensitivity.The systemic toxicity induced by ES can be overcome by administering the drug via injection, which showed excellent antitumor effects in mouse models of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) <ref>[132]</ref>.Some nanoparticles also have their own antivascular effects; for example, Zhang synthesized an H1/pHGFK1 nanoparticle as an angiogenesis inhibitor for GBM therapy; HGFK1 inhibits angiogenesis by regulating the EGFR and bFGF signaling pathways, increasing the resistance of glioblastoma cells to radiotherapy <ref>[133]</ref>.Tian synthesized a CaBP-PEG nanoparticle that depletes TAMs while inhibiting angiogenesis, correcting the abnormal tumor microenvironment to enhance the effect of cancer radioisotope therapy <ref>[134]</ref>.Minafra developed a solid nanoparticle (Cur-SLN) containing curcumin that inhibits VEGF and IL-8 and improves the efficacy of radiotherapy <ref>[135]</ref>.Gold nanoparticles have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis by influencing the expression of growth factors and are effective radiosensitizers <ref>[136]</ref><ref>[137]</ref><ref>[138]</ref>.Yang designed a new gold nanoparticle sensitizer that inhibits HIF-1-mediated angiogenesis and maximizes the tumor attenuation effects of radiation therapy.In addition, gold nanoparticles enhance the vascular damage caused by VDAs, reducing the oxygen supplied through blood vessels, which results in increased hypoxia and enhances the effect of radiation therapy <ref>[139]</ref>.Wu designed iron oxide nanoparticles coupled to azademethylcolchicine (CLIO-ICT), a powerful VDA that binds to tubulin and causes a release of serotonin from platelets, disrupting the tumor vascular system.VDA therapy combined with radiation therapy increases radiation sensitivity, and VDAs can kill cancer cells in hypoxic areas with low radiosensitivity to prevent tumor recurrence after radiation therapy <ref>[140]</ref>.Vascular therapy combined with radiation therapy can improve radiotherapy drug delivery efficiency and radiosensitivity by increasing blood flow perfusion and reducing IFP.In addition, VDAs combined with radiotherapy overcome the insufficient lethality of radiotherapy in tumor sites with low radiation sensitivity.</p>
<h1>Interventional Therapy</h1>
<p>Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is a technique that employs the transcatheter vascular injection of embolic agents to occlude a vessel <ref>[141]</ref>.TAE, in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)), is the gold standard for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <ref>Li, Z and Di, C and Li, S and Yang, X and Nie, G. Smart Nanotherapeutic Targeting of Tumor Vasculature. Acc. Chem. Res. 2019;52:2703-2712. doi:10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00283</ref>.It is challenging to achieve total artery embolism with TAE, as one of the most widely used treatments for solid tumors, such as liver cancer; thus, postoperative recurrence and metastasis are common.Some studies have demonstrated that antivascular therapy combined with TAE can achieve the effective long-term embolization of tumor blood vessels, resulting in the ischemic infarction of tumors [142,143].Shi's team prepared a TF-nanogel (made from PIB-encapsulated tTF-pHLIPs) that diffuses into the peripheral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vasculature via a temperature-sensitive sol-gel phase transition and thus achieves the embolization of blood vessels.Furthermore, tTF-pHLIPs trigger the coagulation cascade to induce thrombosis formation, thus blocking additional arteries.TAE administered via PIB nanogels and the tTF-pHLIP-mediated vascular blockade strategy have achieved longterm vascular occlusion in rabbit models carrying VX2 tumors, effectively inhibiting the tumor recurrence and metastasis seen with TAE alone <ref>[144]</ref>.Due to the persistent hypoxic environment of tumors and the high expression of VEGF after TAE treatment, apatinib can inhibit the growth of residual tumors after embolization, because it inhibits VEGFR-2, and can thus achieve the embolization of blood vessels <ref>[145]</ref>.Zhou used PIB nanogel-loaded apatinib combined with TAE to inhibit the growth of rabbit VX2 liver tumors, overcoming the VEGF overexpression caused by TAE treatment and the issues related to hypoxia after surgery.The study proved that TAE combined with apatinib could be used to continuously embolize blood vessels and improve the long-term efficacy of TAE <ref>[146,</ref><ref>147]</ref>.</p>
<p>In radiofrequency ablation (RFA), electrode needles are inserted directly into the tumor or target tissue under the guidance of imaging equipment, generating local heat energy to ultimately induce coagulation in the tumor <ref>[148]</ref>.However, insufficient RFA treatment promotes tumor angiogenesis and accelerates disease progression <ref>[149]</ref>.Due to the high vascular density of tumors, substantial heat loss is common, which reduces the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation.A series of studies have proven that RFA, combined with antivascular therapy, is superior to RFA alone <ref>[150,</ref><ref>151]</ref>.Li and her team synthesized a kind of RF-responsive divalent gold nanoclusters, which they administered in combination with TAE and radiofrequency ablation (DV GC@PNA RFA).DV GC@PNA RFA effectively reduced the VEGF overexpression caused by hypoxia after TAE and improved tumor cell sensitivity to heat <ref>[152]</ref>.Yuan designed a nanocube (Fe 2 O 3 -PDA-Dox) that they combined with CA4P to treat HCC.CA4P increased the permeability of tumor blood vessels and enhanced the effects of TACE combined with photothermal ablation (pTACE) <ref>[153]</ref>.</p>
<p>Vascular therapy combined with interventional therapy, such as TAE, can achieve the long-term occlusion of tumor blood vessels and prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis.Anti-angiogenic drugs can also inhibit VEGF overexpression after TAE treatment and improve sensitivity to the heat generated by RFA.</p>
<h1>Conclusions and Prospects</h1>
<p>The growth of solid tumors is highly dependent on tumor neovascularization.The complex vascular network ultimately creates therapeutic resistance, which decreases the effects of single-treatment modalities; challenges include the immunosuppressive state and high IFP of the tumor, which prevent deep tumor penetration by the drugs.In addition, the overexpression of VEGF in the tumor greatly increases tumor resistance.Due to the lack of surrounding cells, the oxygen content of the tumor microenvironment is low, decreasing the effectiveness of aerobic therapy.The appropriate use of nanotechnology to achieve the combination of antivascular therapy and conventional treatment can effectively solve the above problems and improve the efficiency of tumor treatment.In addition, different therapeutic approaches can be combined using nanoplatforms.The effectiveness of tumor treatment has been shown to be maximized in some studies by combining chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy.This opens up novel therapeutic avenues for cancer patients <ref>[154,</ref><ref>155]</ref>.Gemcitabine (GEM) and 1-methyltryptophan (1MT) amphiphilic biprodrug (GEM-1MT) were self-assembled into nanoparticles by Luan's team in an aqueous solution to kill tumor cells and reduce immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment <ref>[156]</ref>.Using a platinum@polymer-catechol nanobraker, Dai's team was able to mediate radioimmunotherapy and reduce melanoma's tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and radioresistance.</p>
<p>There are also new treatments being developed for cancer.For example, gene therapy refers to the method of treating diseases by using vectors to transduce exogenous therapeutic genes into cells and then altering the original gene expression of cells with the transcription and translation of exogenous genes <ref>[157]</ref>.In addition, tumors can be controlled or treated with hormonal drugs <ref>[158]</ref>.Emerging treatments such as these can bring a new entry point for combination therapy.Nanoplatforms can also provide new ideas for tumor diagnosis.For example, Yang's team reports a structural and molecular fusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nanoprobe for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors <ref>[159]</ref>.</p>
<p>If you are a doctor or part of the healthcare community, this review could speed up the process of finding promising cancer treatments.We believe that chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the most widely used pharmacotherapies for tumors in clinical practice and that chemotherapy may also be the first option when cancer spreads and metastasizes.Chemotherapy with antivascular therapy has been slowly introduced to patients.Their synergistic action improves the efficiency of tumor treatment.Additional efficacy can be brought to various targeting regimens with the combination of immunotherapy and antivascular therapy, which is more likely to be clinically available.This is not just a drug stack; the effects of the drugs in this combination therapy complement one another.However, the effectiveness of a treatment plan can vary based on factors such as patient response, drug interactions, and side effects.For this reason, it is important to consider which antivascular drugs may work better in combination therapy.For example, both sorafenib and bevacizumab can be used as antivascular agents for combination immunotherapy, but bevacizumab has been shown to be superior to sorafenib in prolonging progression-free survival in a phase III clinical trial <ref>[160,</ref><ref>161]</ref>.The combination of nano-and antivascular drugs has entered clinical trials.CRLX101 is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate.In a sequential phase II clinical trial, the team found that CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab improved the objective response rate in recurrent ovarian cancer <ref>[162]</ref>.In a phase I-IIa clinical trial, CRLX101 in combination with bevacizumab was found to improve progression-free survival in metastatic renal cell carcinoma <ref>[163]</ref>.In a phase III clinical trial, carboplatin-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-bevacizumab was found to improve overall survival in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer <ref>[164]</ref>.However, most of the research related to nanodrug combination therapy strategies is still in the experimental stage and always meets failure when they are put into clinical trials.In terms of biosafety in human bodies, it is particularly important to monitor the complex tumor microenvironment in real time to assess a variety of characteristics related to treatment resistance.In addition, factors such as big-scale manufacturing as well as batch-to-batch consistency are essentially important for the successful translation of the antivascular nanomedicine from bench to bedside.The research and clinical translation of nanomedicines is both a challenge and an opportunity.In recent years, new intelligent antitumor vascular nanodrugs have made significant scientific progress and will likely play an increasingly important role in tumor treatment in the future.Using multiple methods of synergistic therapy is an indispensable treatment strategy for middle and advanced tumors, and the combination of nanomedicine can improve the efficiency of drug delivery, reduce drug side effects, and improve the efficiency of tumor treatment.With the continuous advancement of technology and the deepening of research, we believe that in the near future, more combinations of nanodrugs and antivascular drugs will enter the clinic setting and that they will achieve more excellent therapeutic effects, achieve the long-term and high-quality survival of tumor patients, and bring more hope and confidence to tumor patients.</p>

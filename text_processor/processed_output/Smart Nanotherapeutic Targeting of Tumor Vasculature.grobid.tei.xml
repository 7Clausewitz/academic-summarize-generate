<title level="a" type="main">Smart Nanotherapeutic Targeting of Tumor Vasculature</title>
<abstract>The past decades have witnessed the development of a field dedicated to targeting tumor vasculature for cancer therapy.In contrast to conventional chemotherapeutics that need to penetrate into tumor tissues for killing tumor cells, the agents targeting tumor vascular system have two major advantages: direct contact with vascular endothelial cells or the blood and less possibility to induce drug resistance because of high gene stability of endothelial cells.More specifically, various angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) and vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that block tumor blood supply to inhibit tumor progression, some of which have been applied clinically, have been described.However, off-target effects and high effective doses limit the utility of these formulations in cancer patients.Thus, new strategies with improved therapeutic efficacy and safety are needed for tumor vessel targeting therapy.With the burgeoning developments in nanotechnology, smart nanotherapeutics now offer unprecedented potential for targeting tumor vasculature.Based on specific structural and functional features of the tumor vasculature, a number of different nanoscale delivery systems have been proposed for cancer therapy.In this Account, we summarize several distinct strategies to modulate tumor vasculature with various smart nanotherapeutics for safe and effective tumor therapy developed by our research programs.Inspired by the blood coagulation cascade, we generated nanoparticle-mediated tumor vessel infarction strategies that selectively block tumor blood supply to starve the tumor to death.By specifically delivering thrombin loaded DNA nanorobots (Nanorobot-Th) into tumor vessels, an intratumoral thrombosis is triggered to induce vascular infarction and, ultimately, tumor necrosis.Mimicking the coagulation cascade, a smart polymeric nanogel achieves permanent and peripheral embolization of liver tumors.Considering the critical role of platelets in maintaining tumor vessel integrity, a hybrid (PLP-D-R) nanoparticle selectively depleting tumor-associated platelets (TAP) to boost tumor vessel permeability was developed for enhancing intratumoral drug accumulation.In addition, benefiting from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vascular normalization, several tumor acidity responsive nanotherapeutics, encapsulating therapeutic peptides, and small interfering RNA were developed to correct the abnormal features of the tumor vasculature.This made the tumor vessels more efficient for drug delivery.While we are still exploring the mechanisms of action of these novel nanoformulations, we expect that the strategies summarized here will offer a promising platform to design effective next-generation nanotherapeutics against cancer and facilitate the clinical translation of smart nanotherapeutics that target tumor vasculature.</abstract>

<p>In the past three decades, tumor vasculature-targeting therapy has become a hot spot of research, out of which angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) <ref>Jain, R.

Vascular targeting agents as cancer therapeutics. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004;10:415-427.</ref> have been developed and tested or even applied in the clinic.The major goal of AIs is to inhibit tumor vascularization by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or its receptor (VEGFR) activity with antibodies or small molecule drugs such as bevacizumab, ramucirumab, and sorafenib.However, VDAs, such as CA4P, CA1P, and ASA404, aim at disrupting existing tumoral endothelial cells to incur thrombosis and block tumor blood supply.Recently, several AIs have also been shown to correct the abnormalities of structure and function of tumor vessels to increase the efficacy of conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy by alleviating hypoxia and enhancing drug delivery in both preclinical and clinical settings. <ref>Jain, R.

Nanotechnological strategies for therapeutic targeting of tumor vasculature. Nanomedicine. 2013;8:1209-1222.</ref>First, by functionalizing the surfaces of nanotherapeutics with targeting ligand molecules (e.g., peptides, aptamers, and antibodies), nanotherapeutics can precisely target and bind tumor endothelial cells, thus reducing adverse, off-target effects and improving antitumor efficacy.Second, nanocarriers can simultaneously carry multiple therapeutic agents to effect combined therapy, precisely synchronizing both the temporal and spatial antitumor attack. <ref>Zhao, Y and Ji, T and Wang, H and Li, S and Zhao, Y and Nie, G.

China: Chem. 2018;61:1503-1552.</ref>nspired by the unique advantages of targeting tumor vasculature and the rapid developments in nanotechnology, in recent years, we have developed a series of tumor microenvironment-responsive nanotherapeutics to modulate tumor vessels for effective cancer therapy.Herein, we describe four distinct smart nanotherapeutic strategies to effectively manipulate the tumor vasculature system, Table 1.The first two strategies selectively occlude tumor vessels by delivering the coagulation protein, thrombin, using a DNA nanorobot or a temperature-sensitive polymeric nanogel delivered into tumor tissues by a surgical catheter.The third strategy is to correct abnormalities in tumor vessels with pH-responsive nanotherapeutics to enhance drug perfusion, while the fourth strategy employs polymeric nanotherapeutics to potentiate tumor vessel permeability by locally depleting tumorassociated platelets (TAPs).The challenges and future directions of these nanotherapeutic strategies will also be discussed.</p>
<h1>SELECTIVE INFARCTION OF TUMOR BLOOD VESSELS WITH BIOACTIVE MOLECULE-LOADED NANOTHERAPEUTICS</h1>
<p>There is increasing evidence suggesting that tissue factor (TF), the major initiating receptor in the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway, is overexpressed on tumor endothelial cell and tumor cell surfaces. <ref>Jahanban-Esfahlan, R and Seidi, K and Zarghami, N.

Fibrin as a component of the tumor stroma: origins and biological significance. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1983;2:41-73.</ref>Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that, compared to normal organs, blood coagulation events in tumor tissues can be more readily activated to block blood supply.To this end, a truncated TF (tTF), containing only the extracellular domain of TF, which exhibits negligible activity when free in blood, was delivered to tumor vessels with an antibody specific for the tumor endothelium to affect coagulation-based tumor therapy. <ref>Huang, X and Molema, G and King, S and Watkins, L and Edgington, T and Thorpe, P. Tumor infarction in mice by antibody-directed targeting of tissue factor to tumor vasculature. Science. 1997;275:547-550.</ref>When bound to the tumoral endothelial surface, the coagulation-inducing activity of tTF occurred, thus inducing rapid thrombosis in tumor vasculature to ultimately cause tumor necrosis.Taking a similar approach, we fused tTF with a pH low membrane insertion peptide (pHLIP) to construct the tTF-pHLIP fusion protein, which targets and inserts itself into the endothelial surface of tumor vessels upon exposure to the acidic tumor microenvironment.This formulation resulted in local intravascular thrombosis and tumor infarction in both human breast MDA-MB-231 and B16-F10 melanoma tumor-bearing mice. <ref>Li, S and Tian, Y and Zhao, Y and Zhang, Y and Su, S and Wang, J and Wu, M and Shi, Q and Anderson, G and Thomsen, J and Zhao, R and Ji, T and Nie, G and Wang, J. pHLIP-mediated targeting of truncated tissue factor to tumor vessels causes vascular occlusion and impairs tumor growth.

<h1>NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR TRANSCATHETER</h1>
<p>ARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION OR CHEMOEMBOLIZATION THERAPY OF LIVER CANCER Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is a technique of selectively injecting embolic agents through a catheter to a target artery under the guidance of medical imaging devices to obstruct the target artery for tumor therapy. <ref>Llovet, J and Bruix, J and Canc, G. Systematic review of randomized trials for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Chemoembolization improves survival. Hepatology. 2003;37:429-442.</ref>Considered a revolutionary treatment, TAE produces rapid effects, while incurring a low incidence of complications and is easy to combine with other therapies.For instance, the combination of TAE with chemotherapeutic drugs, also known as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), is the gold standard, firstline palliative therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which was shown to have the largest concentration case in Asia.In the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification and treatment schedule, TACE is advocated for intermediate B stage and selected patients of advanced stage HCC. <ref>Llovet, J and Fuster, J and Bruix, J. The Barcelona approach: diagnosis, staging, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver Transpl. 2004;10:115-120.</ref>he clinical benefits of TAE/TACE for HCC mainly rely on the pathological vasculature of liver tumors, which derive more than 90% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery.In contrast, normal liver tissue has a dual blood supply, with 25% coming from the hepatic artery and the rest from portal vein.Therefore, hepatic arterial blood flow management specifically targets liver tumors with the normal liver fraction largely unaffected.The embolization of the hepatic artery induces ischemic tumor necrosis and regression.Additionally, in TACE, superselective administration of a high dosage of chemotherapy drugs to the tumor tissues contributes to a potent cytotoxic effect while simultaneously mitigating systemic side effects.</p>
<p>The embolic agents chosen for vascular embolization play a decisive role in TAE and TACE, thereby dictating the antitumor efficacy against HCC. <ref>Chen, H and Gu, Z and An, H and Chen, C and Chen, J and Cui, R and Chen, S and Chen, W and Chen, X and Chen, X and Chen, Z and Ding, B and Dong, Q and Fan, Q and Fu, T and Hou, D and Jiang, Q and Ke, H and Jiang, X and Liu, G and Li, S and Li, T and Liu, Z and Nie, G and Ovais, M and Pang, D and Qiu, N and Shen, Y and Tian, H and Wang, C and Wang, H and Wang, Z and Xu, H and Xu, J.-F and Yang, X and Zhu, S and Zheng, X and Zhang, X and Zhao, Y and Tan, W and Zhang, X and Zhao, Y. Precise nanomedicine for intelligent therapy of cancer. Sci. China: Chem. 2018;61:1503-1552.</ref>A wide range of solid and liquid embolic agents are used clinically for TAE and TACE against HCC, including gelatin sponges, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) particles, calcium alginate microspheres, absolute alcohol, and Lipiodol.However, all these materials suffer from overt shortcomings.Insufficient embolization often induces vascular recanalization and collateral circulation in the tumor, ultimately leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis.An ideal embolic agent should possess two conflicting characteristics: flowability and embolization.During the catheter delivery, the embolic agent should have a low viscosity.Otherwise, it will stick to the inner wall of the catheter and obstruct flow, giving rise to operational difficulties.Once delivered to the artery supplying tumors, the agent should occlude all tumor feeding vessels with high mechanical strength.This section summarizes the past decade of progress in developing polymeric nanogel and radiopaque nanoparticle-based embolic agents for TAE and TACE.</p>
<h1>Intelligent Nanogel-Based Embolic Agents</h1>
<p>Inspired by the changes in blood from a liquid state to a solidlike gel state in the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into cross-linked fibrin clots, we developed a smart poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-butyl methyl acrylate) (PIB) nanogel, which displays an intriguing temperature-triggered sol-gel phase transition, for permanent and peripheral embolization of liver tumors. <ref>Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Wang, Q and Fang, J and Zhou, G and Zhao, H and Yang, Y and Xu, H and Feng, G and Yang, X.

<p>To evaluate in situ embolization status, the PIB nanogel was mixed with the X-ray contrast agent iohexol, which not only decreased the VPTT of PIB from 46 to 36.5 C but also reduced the CGC of PIB from 10 wt % to 5 wt %.Therefore, a 6 wt % PIB concentration was selected to combine with 150 mg of iodide/mL iohexol to generate "PIBI-6150".Similar to PIB nanogel dispersions, PIBI-6150 also showed the three characteristic states, that is, a phase 1 swollen gel, phase 2 flowable sol, and phase 3 shrunken gel.More importantly, the rheological properties of PIBI-6150 indicate that the nanogel possesses better flowability in phase 2 and a higher embolized mechanical strength in phase 3 than PIB nanogel dispersions.Before injection into the target artery, PIBI-6150 was stored at a relative low temperature in the flowable sol state, which is the desired state for delivering embolic agents via catheter for TAE or TACE.Once the sol arrives at the target artery, the body temperature stimulates PIBI-6150 to transform from a flowable sol to a solid-like gel, triggering the embolization.Because of the abundant and hierarchical vessels in the kidney, the embolization capacity of PIBI-6150 was evaluated in the kidneys of normal New Zealand rabbits.Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging revealed that PIBI-6150 effectively occluded all tumor vessels for up to 60 days whereas artery collateral circulation occurred in the Ivalon (poly(vinyl alcohol) microparticles) treatment group.The embolization effect of PIBI-6150 was investigated in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model.Due to its excellent flowability and embolization, PIBI-6150 occluded the arteries from the aorta to the peripheral capillaries consistently better than Ivalon and Lipiodol (Figure 3).The strong gel embolus formed by PIBI-6150 induced neither collateral circulation nor vascular recanalization and elicited better antitumor efficacy compared with the clinically approved Ivalon and Lipiodol.</p>

Theranostics. 2018;8:6291-6306.</ref> a PIB nanogel concentration of 2 wt % with 240 mg of iodide/mL iohexol (Figure 4A).Compared with PIBI-6150, the concentration of PIB nanogel in PIBI-2240 is significantly lower, thereby causing not only a lower viscosity in the sol phase but, more importantly, a stronger embolization in the gel phase.To study the in vitro arteryembolization properties of PIBI-2240, a biomimetic model with two microfluidic chips was created to mimic tumor vasculature (Figure 4B).PIBI-2240 completely occluded all eight levels of microchannels from 20 to 800 m in diameter.In contrast, with its higher viscosity, PIBI-6150 could not occlude the narrowest three channels with widths of 20, 100, and 200 m.Although Lipiodol also achieved the complete occlusion of all eight levels of channels, the embolization induced by Liopodol could not withstand even a modest flush with PBS.The superior embolization properties of PIBI-2240 translated into the best antitumor effects in VX2 tumor-bearing rabbits, including eliciting the lowest expression of HIF-1, VEGF, and CD31.We have also implemented TACE therapy for HCC with a doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded PIB nanogel-iohexol mixture, which proved the most effective in rabbit VX2 liver tumors compared to transcatheter artery chemotherapy treatment with free DOX or TAE treatment with PIB nanogel-iohexol dispersions. <ref>Qian, K and Ma, Y and Wan, J and Geng, S and Li, H and Fu, Q and Peng, X and Kan, X and Zhou, G and Liu, W and Xiong, B and Zhao, Y and Zheng, C and Yang, X and Xu, H.

<h1>Radiopaque Nanoparticle-Based Embolic Agents</h1>
<p>TAE or TACE therapy is always performed and guided with medical imaging, usually an X-ray modality.Therefore, X-ray radiopacity in embolic agents is essential not only for precise and accurate embolization of the target artery but, more importantly, for real-time in situ monitoring of embolization status post-TAE or -TACE, preventing the need for repeated intravenous injections of contrast media during re-examination.Unfortunately, most embolic agents used clinically for TAE and TACE lack intrinsic radiopacity, which has severely limited the progress of TAE and TACE therapies.</p>
<p>In PIB nanogel dispersions including PIBI-6150, PIBI-2240, and the DOX loaded PIB nanogel-iohexol mixture, the iodinated contrast agent, iohexol, was always combined with the PIB nanogel.Other embolic agents in clinical TAE and TACE therapies also need to combine with iohexol.However, since iohexol most likely interacts with embolic agents via hydrogen bonding, there is a risk that iohexol diffuses out of the embolic agents and does not accurately reflect the location of embolic agents.Additionally, iohexol is contraindicated in patients who suffer from a relatively common iodine allergy.To address the limitations of iodine-based contrast agents in TAE and TACE therapy, gold nanoparticles (GNP) were blended with PIB nanogel to obtain novel blood-vesselembolic agents for high-resolution angiography. <ref>Ma, Y and Wan, J and Qian, K and Geng, S and He, N and Zhou, G and Zhao, Y and Yang, X.

<h1>NORMALIZATION OF TUMOR VESSELS WITH SMART NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR ENHANCED ANTITUMOR EFFICACY AND METASTASIS SUPPRESSION</h1>
<p>For progression and metastasis to occur, tumors develop a unique neovascularization paradigm, in which new blood vessels form by sprouting on pre-existing capillaries. <ref>Jain, R. Antiangiogenesis Strategies Revisited: From Starving Tumors to Alleviating Hypoxia. Cancer Cell. 2014;26:605-622.</ref> The newly formed vessels are tortuous and leaky, with a lack of structural integrity, containing large gaps between endothelial cells, missing smooth muscle cells, and exhibiting incomplete coverage by pericytes and basement membrane.Unlike normal vasculature, the blood flow in tumors does not always follow a constant, unidirectional track; not all vessels are perfused well, and the blood flow may take varied paths and even flow in opposed directions via the same vessel over a short period of time.The structural and functional vessel abnormalities contribute to a prothrombotic state, serpentine blood flow, and poor perfusion, thereby shaping a distinctive microenvironment (tumor microenvironment; TME) generally characterized by hypoxia, hypercoagulation, and immunosuppression.</p>
<p>Correction of the abnormal features of the tumor vasculature ("normalization") with AIs has emerged as an important therapeutic paradigm in cancer treatment. <ref>Jain, R. Antiangiogenesis Strategies Revisited: From Starving Tumors to Alleviating Hypoxia. Cancer Cell. 2014;26:605-622.</ref><ref>Fukumura, D and Kloepper, J and Amoozgar, Z and Duda, D and Jain, R. Enhancing cancer immunotherapy using antiangiogenics: opportunities and challenges. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2018;15:325-340.</ref>However, biopharmaceutical based AIs have poor stability in the circulation and lack any specific tumor-targeting properties, limiting their therapeutic efficacy and clinical translation.</p>
<p>Employing a surface charge switchable polymeric nanoparticle, small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be selectively delivered to tumor sites to normalize tumor vessels.Using this approach to disrupt the expression of Nogo-B receptor (NgBR siRNA) can reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to inhibit tumor metastasis. <ref>Wang, B and Ding, Y and Zhao, X and Han, X and Yang, N and Zhang, Y and Zhao, Y and Zhao, X and Taleb, M and Miao, Q and Nie, G. Delivery of small interfering RNA against Nogo-B receptor via tumor-acidity responsive nanoparticles for tumor vessel normalization and metastasis suppression. Biomaterials. 2018;175:110-122.</ref>To protect NgBR siRNA from degradation in the blood, 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (DMMA)-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 2 -poly-(ethylenimine), (PLGA) 2 -PEI-DMMA, was used to construct the nanocarrier.The design's features and mechanisms of action are presented in Figure 6.DMMA was first conjugated to the surface amines of (PLGA) 2 -PEI micelles to afford (PLGA) 2 -PEI-DMMA nanoparticles, which were positively charged under physiological conditions.Therefore, negatively charged NgBR siRNA adsorbed onto the surface of (PLGA) 2 -PEI-DMMA nanoparticles via electrostatic attraction.The optimized NP-NgBR siRNA possesses a negative surface charge in the blood but intelligently switches to a positive surface charge by DMMA cleavage in response to the low pH in the tumor.This tumor microenvironment-specific responsive feature was beneficial for the delivery of NgBR siRNA to tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells, resulting in potent NgBR silencing in tumors.Consequently, NP-NgBR siRNA impaired endothelial cell migration and normalized vessel structures, collectively lessening the invasive potential of cancer cells but not suppressing tumor growth.In another example, by conjugation of the short therapeutic peptide, C16Y, with the functional hydrophobic molecule, 3-diethylaminopropyl isothiocyanate (DEAP), we tailored an amphiphilic chimeric peptide, DEAP-C16Y, which retards vascular endothelial cell migration, tubule formation, and tumor cell invasion.DEAP-C16Y self-assembles into nanoparticles (DEAP-C16Y NPs) under physiological conditions but dissociates in the acidic tumor environment.Accordingly, DEAP-C16Y NPs exhibited superior stability over C16Y, leading to a prolonged circulation half-life and dramatic inhibitory effects on angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. <ref>Ding, Y and Ji, T and Zhao, Y and Zhang, Y and Zhao, X and Zhao, R and Lang, J and Zhao, X and Shi, J and Sukumar, S and Nie, G. Improvement of Stability and Efficacy of C16Y Therapeutic Peptide via Molecular Self-Assembly into Tumor-Responsive Nanoformulation. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2015;14:2390-2400.</ref>In addition to its intrinsic antitumor effects, DEAP-C16Y NPs can also be used to encapsulate hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents, such as DOX, to achieve combination therapy.</p>
<h1>LOCAL DEPLETION OF TUMOR-ASSOCIATED</h1>
<p>PLATELETS WITH NANOTHERAPEUTICS FOR ENHANCED DRUG DELIVERY Both quantity and activity of platelets are increased in cancer patients.In the context of cancer, platelets promote not only tumor progression but also tumor metastasis. <ref>Lip, G and Chin, B and Blann, A. Cancer and the prothrombotic state. Lancet Oncol. 2002;3:27-34.</ref>Activated by TF overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment, platelets release proangiogenic factors to stimulate the growth and propagation of tumor endothelium. <ref>Sharma, D and Brummel-Ziedins, K and Bouchard, B and Holmes, C. Platelets in Tumor Progression: A Host Factor That Offers Multiple Potential Targets in the Treatment of Cancer. J. Cell. Physiol. 2014;229:1005-1015.</ref>By controlling vascular tone and permeability, platelets also play a pivotal role in maintaining tumor vessel integrity, preventing not only tumor hemorrhage but also filtration and penetration of immune effector cells.In addition, by sequestering and conveying tumor cell-derived proteins, such as GM-CSF, TNF-, VEGF and TGF-, to distal tissues, platelets facilitate the formation of premetastatic niches. <ref>Gay, L and Felding-Habermann, B. Contribution of platelets to tumour metastasis. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011;11:123-134.</ref>During this process, platelets accelerate the transformation of tumor cells from an epithelial state to a mesenchymal state through direct interactions with tumor cells.Moreover, platelets help to shield cancer cells from recognition and eradication by immune cells, such as NK cells, by encapsulating disseminated cancer cells in the circulation.The adhesion between cancer cells and the endothelium is strengthened by platelets, preparing cancer cells for extravasation at distal tissues.</p>
<p>In view of the diverse contributions of platelets to tumor progression and metastasis, an appealing antitumor approach has been developed to decrease the number or suppress the activity of platelets.The caveat to systematic depletion of platelets is the high risk of severe bleeding, a frequent complication in clinical settings, which limits wide clinical application of antiplatelet agents.To overcome this limitation, we have constructed tumor microenvironment-responsive polymeric nanoparticles that specifically deplete tumorassociated platelets (TAPs) to enhance vascular permeability and potentiate drug accumulation in tumors. <ref>Li, S and Zhang, Y and Wang, J and Zhao, Y and Ji, T and Zhao, X and Ding, Y and Zhao, X and Zhao, R and Li, F and Yang, X and Liu, S and Liu, Z and Lai, J and Whittaker, A and Anderson, G and Wei, J and Nie, G. Nanoparticle-mediated local depletion of tumour-associated platelets disrupts vascular barriers and augments drug accumulation in tumours. Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2017;1:667-679.</ref>With a tumorhoming, pentapeptide-functionalized liposomal nanoparticle (CREKA-Lipo-T), we have also specifically inhibited the secretion function of TAPs for reduced metastasis. <ref>Zhang, Y and Wei, J and Liu, S and Wang, J and Han, X and Qin, H and Lang, J and Cheng, K and Li, Y and Qi, Y and Anderson, G and Sukumar, S and Li, S and Nie, G. Inhibition of platelet function using liposomal nanoparticles blocks tumor metastasis. Theranostics. 2017;7:1062-1071.</ref>o locally deplete TAPs, we developed a polymer-lipidpeptide nanoparticle, encapsulating the antiplatelet monoclonal antibody R300 and chemotherapeutic drug DOX (PLP-D-R).The design features of this formulation are depicted in Figure 7A.First, the biocompatible and biodegradable block copolymer poly(etherimide)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 2 (PEI-(PLGA) 2 ) was used to encapsulate DOX and form the core nanoparticles (P-D).Negatively charged R300 was subsequently loaded onto the surface of P-D via electrostatic interaction, due to the positive charges from PEI, to obtain P-D-R.A shell layer consisting of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)-dissociable peptide, lecthins, and PEGylated phospholipids, capable of preventing leakage of R300 and burst release of DOX, was finally anchored on the surface of P-D-R to fabricate PLP-D-R.The peptides on the shell are cleaved by overexpressed MMP2 on the tumoral endothelium, ensuring PLP-D-R specifically dissociates in tumor tissue, thus mitigating off-target side effects.As shown in the schematic in Figure 7B, PLP-D-R nanoparticles dissociate and release R300 to selectively deplete TAPs, increasing vascular leakage and drug perfusion in tumors.The critical MMP2 responsiveness of PLP-D-R was confirmed by evaluating the activity of released R300 and monitoring the DOX release profile.Due to its high expression of MMP2, a MCF7 tumor-bearing mouse model was used for in vivo tumor-targeting and antitumor activity evaluation.Fluorescence, photoacoustic, and positron emission tomography imaging collectively confirmed that R300 promoted the tumor homing of PLP-D-R nanoparticles by depleting intratumoral platelets and subsequently disrupting tumor vascular barriers.Accordingly, compared to control groups treated with nanoparticles without R300, more DOX and Evans blue accumulated in tumors in the PLP-D-R treatment group.As a result, PLP-D-R achieved potent tumor growth inhibition in MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (Figure 7C) but only a modest suppressive effect in A549 lung tumorbearing mice whose tumors do not express a high level of MMP2.PLP-D-R also significantly inhibited tumor metastasis in 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice (Figure 7D).Importantly, PLP-D-R depletes TAPs while sparing normal circulating platelets, causing negligible changes in the bleeding time of mice.In stark contrast, free R300 decreased platelets indiscriminately, leading to deficient hemostasis and bleeding in the lungs of mice.Though the mechanism of action still warrants further investigation, PLP-D-R modulates tumor blood vessels by locally depleting TAPs for enhanced drug delivery and antitumor efficacy.</p>
<h1>SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK</h1>
<p>Table 1 summarizes the above-mentioned smart nanotherapeutics, which are paradigms for distinct strategies to manipulate the tumor vasculature system.While these smart nanotherapeutics achieved potent in vivo therapeutic efficacy owing to their unique advantages, each has its own limitations.For nanotherapeutics (tTF-pHLIP, NP-NgBR-siRNA, DEAP-C16Y NPs) utilizing pH as a trigger, they have a common specificity issue.For example, in addition to tumor sites, inflammation tissues also have a decreased pH microenvironment.This to some extent would lead to the accumulation of low pH responsive nanotherapeutics.An experienced surgery operator is essential for successful TAE or TACE therapy using PIB nanogels as embolic agents.In addition, large-scale production of nanotherapeutics is essential for even preclinical tests in large animal models, not to mention the quantities required for clinical trials.These crucial challenges still need to be addressed before clinical translation of the nanotherapeutics.</p>
<p>Numerous novel nanotherapeutics that enrich the strategies summarized here are envisaged.Loading PIB nanogels with TF or thrombin will achieve a localized synergistic obstruction of tumor vessels via a combination of physical embolization and biological coagulation.Encapsulating radioactive lutetium nanoparticles together with radiopaque tantalum nanoparticles inside calcium alginate microspheres may yield theranostic "nano-in-micro" structures for precise TAE and radiation combination therapy.Unique biological molecules or tissues, such as E-selectin, CD105, fibrin, tumor-associated pericytes, and endothelial cells, can be specifically targeted with nanotherapeutics to further increase tumor vessel permeability.Since the filtration and penetration of immune effector cells are critically hampered by the aberrant and dysfunctional tumor vasculature, <ref>Huang, Y and Kim, B and Chan, C and Hahn, S and Weissman, I and Jiang, W. Improving immune-vascular crosstalk for cancer immunotherapy. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018;18:195-203.</ref> enhancing tumor vessel permeability for immune cells with smart nanotherapeutics represents a promising means to boost the therapeutic efficacy of existing cancer immunotherapies.Moreover, co-delivery of conventional AIs with chemotherapeutic drugs in one nanoplatform will lead to more profound modulation of tumor vasculature and suppression of tumor growth and metastasis.</p>

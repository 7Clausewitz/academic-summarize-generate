      "text": "In recent years, immunotherapy has played a key role in tumor treatment, but its development is still hindered by many factors.Studies have shown that antivascular therapy can improve the immunosuppressive microenvironment and increase infiltration by immune effector cells.Table 1 describes existing combination antivascular therapy and immunotherapy strategies and the mechanisms of action of antivascular drugs; these strategies can achieve selective drug delivery and drug accumulation in the tumor microenvironment when combined with nanotherapy.CD8 + T cells play a crucial role in antitumor immunological therapy because of their direct antitumor cytotoxic function.Programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) is an immunosuppressive receptor located on T cells that can bind to programmed cell death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) located on stromal cells, inhibiting the activation of T cells and making them incapable of attacking.PD-L1 is highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and inhibits the immune-killing function of CD8 + T cells.Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective as tumor treatment because they block the binding of PD-L1/PD-1.ICIs directly block the effect of PD-1 on CD8 + T cells, decreasing their proliferation <ref>Juneja, V and Mcguire, K and Manguso, R and Lafleur, M and Collins, N and Haining, W and Freeman, G and Sharpe, A.
